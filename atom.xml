<em>Posted on January  1, 2024</em>
    
</div>

<p>It’s been an interesting year of tech layoffs, bad economy, generative AI, endless wars and more effects of climate change
(record highs in many places?).
I don’t really know what else to make of this year, other than it mostly wasn’t great, and that I generally avoided the news
(and X, the site formerly known as Twitter).
I’m still relatively fortunate though.
At least we’re not living in war, I’m still employed and climate change has not decimated my city yet.
So overall, I would say that this year has been pretty good for me.</p>
<p>In the spirit of avoiding things, I started avoiding <em>reading</em> this year.
By the last quarter of the year, I was super stressed from work and started craving <em>escapism</em>,
which meant that I would sacrifice sleep to read some pretty bad romance novels.
I would regularly read a book until 3 a.m which meant that I would be randomly napping between meetings the next day.
So I just stopped reading novels altogether since I’ve already hit my reading goal of the year.
In general, it was kind of a slump of a reading year, with most of my favourite books read in the first half.
Some highlights (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61058107-the-staff-engineer-s-path">The Staff Engineer’s Path</a> by Tanya Reilly</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366223-the-great-displacement">The Great Displacement</a> by Jake Bittle</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59808117-ocean-s-echo">Ocean’s Echo</a> by Everina Maxwell</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50892360-black-sun">Black Star</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57339626-fevered-star">Fevered Sun</a> by Rebecca Roanhorse</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62918341-weather-together">Weather Together</a> by Jessie Sima</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60850767-children-of-memory">Children of Memory</a> by Adrian Tschaikovsky</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of stress from work, I might have been pushing myself too hard this year.
I wanted a Staff Engineer title, changed my job last year to get it, and now I’m stressed out.
Anyways, I’ll try to be more realistic about the number of “side-quests” that I pick up next year.
I spoke at an internal work conference, so that checks off a career bucket-list item.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed search results (from Google, Duckduckgo) getting shittier this year.
But it’s only because I now work for an <em>internet</em> company that I’ve noticed.</p>
<p>I’ve never tested positive for COVID before,
and have generally been very diligent with wearing a mask.
I’ve also being vaccinated and boosted when I get the opportunity.
But I somehow tested positive with COVID for the first time this year.
It might not be the first time I actually contracted COVID,
especially given the sensitivity of the test is not very great.
COVID also robbed me of my opportunity to attend the <em>last Strangeloop ever</em>.
I’m still a bit bummed about it.</p>
<p>I had spent a lot of money and time on fountain pens this year.
I started using a fountain pen around 2015 or 2016 with a Lamy Safari and had most of my pens gifted to me.
My main everyday carry combination for the longest time was a TWSBI Eco-T inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Ama-iro.
This year I really expanded my collection, especially after I discovered Aliexpress
and a whole new world of cheap (but good quality) Chinese fountain pens.
So, here is an updated selection of my favourite pens and inks:</p>
<ul>
<li>TWSBI Diamond 580 with White Rosegold inked with Ferriswheel Press Writing Desk</li>
<li>Majohn A2 inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Konpeki</li>
<li>Opus 88 Demo in Sapphire inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo</li>
<li>Penbbs 355 Galaxy inked with Ferriswheel Press Stroke of Midnight</li>
<li>Platinum Plaisir inked with Platinum Carbon Black</li>
<li>Majohn C4 inked with Jacques Herbin’s Emerald of Chivor.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also haven’t done much travelling this year.
Planning trips with a toddler is a major pain,
so the only trip that I took was a work trip to Montreal
(in which I returned home early because of COVID exposure…
it was not the same COVID that I eventually got).
Do I wish to travel more in the next year?
Maybe. But I’ve been struggling with the effects of air travel on the climate,
as well as the changes to the way I travel to accomodate a child.</p>
<p>I played a lot of piano this year.
Most of the stuff that I played were “by-ear”.
So, transcribing various nursery rhymes (then turning them evil by switching to minor key
or jazzing them up in the bossa nova style).
I also re-explored my roots with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh_C%C3%B4ng_S%C6%A1n">Trịnh Công Sơn</a>
and my childhood with some sheet music that I found in my parents house
(mostly video game music transcriptions).
I’m always going to be an amateur because I never take the <em>practice</em> seriously.
It’s all for my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>I spent the remaining holiday days at the end of the year backing up some CDs from my youth.
Looking at relics of my past was unexpectantly nostalgic, and also kind of sad.
I also wonder how my child will think about the idea of backing up stuff with CD/DVDs.
In fact, it’s pretty incredulous that this was how I did it back in 2004 to 2007.
It was certainly cheaper to get a set of 50 empty disks than buy a harddrive
(of which, I neither had the skills, money, nor equipment to actually use at the time).</p>
<p>In terms of New Year Resolution, I guess the only thing that I’ve been meaning to do more of is look after my health.
I haven’t exercised, and have been eating pretty poorly.
Exercise will be hard to fit into my schedule (and it’s hard to motivate yourself to do something you hate,
especially if you’ve got a stressful job, parenting responsbilities, and living through a rough economy),
but maybe I can fix my diet.
And I should learn Chinese more seriously by taking online classes.
And maybe also draw and paint more.</p>

    <title>Product Limits, You're Going to Need Them</title>

<p>Limits on the product functionality
is often overlooked and added too late.
They tend to be considered after we run into problems with the API,
usually after a major incident where we ask
<em>“how could this have been prevented”</em> in the incident review.
However, once users are accustomed to a certain way of calling the API,
it becomes <em>incredibly</em> difficult to add the limit without annoying those users
(will likely involve getting them to migrate to a new API or you needing to set a custom limit on them,
which won’t result any customer satisfaction either way).
And if they’re paying users, than that might just sink your business.
So, it’s good to set product limits early to ensure more predictable and manageable operations.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-thinking-about-product-limits">Guidelines for Thinking about Product Limits</h2>
<p>I like to come up with checklists on what to think about when it comes making sure I consider <em>stuff</em>
(not just product limits) when designing a new system.
These product limit questions are not meant to be exhaustive,
but just serve as a starting point for thinking about where to add limits.
In my experience, there are generally a few areas where these types of limits should be considered:</p>
<h3 id="api-level-limits">API Level Limits</h3>
<p>These limits are the ones that exists on the API.
Generally, these are the easiest to understand
as there are lots of examples of APIs that implemented these
which you can look at.
They usually involve some sort of limit on request and response.
Some useful questions you may want to ask yourself when thinking about designing a new API:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we want to set a rate limit on the API? What do we want limit on? (ie. account rate limiting? session rate limiting?)</p></li>
<li><p>For endpoints where we return a list of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of pagination strategy can/should we use? (ie. cursor, offset/limit etc.)</li>
<li>How many results should we return as default on a single page?</li>
<li>How many results should we set as a max on a single request?</li>
<li>How far back do we allow users to paginate?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What should our response SLAs be?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storage-limits">Storage Limits</h3>
<p>These limits generally deal with how long we store data
and potential contractual limits set on the data.
Storage and data access are not free,
so we should always consider trimming off the unnecessary data
and being explicit about the limitations on storage and access.
Some questions you might want to ask yourself about the data you’re adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What should our retention policy be? How do we enforce this?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we want to set a limit to how many objects we store per account/user? How do we enforce this?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we want to consider tiered access, where users can access data by certain APIs up to certain point,
but require a different API or need to contact our customer support for data beyond that threshold?</p></li>
<li><p>Should there be size limits for uploaded files?</p></li>
<li><p>Should there be number of files uploaded for the user? account? session?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="third-party-request-limits">Third Party Request Limits</h3>
<p>We want to also consider limits when talking to downstream dependencies.
If you application will require a lot of network requests to downstream services,
then it would be good to think about the sort of interactions that are acceptable
which will affect some of the API contract requirements that we will have.
Some questions you may want to ask yourself as you inventory your downsteam requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What sorts of timeouts make sense? Given our SLAs?</p></li>
<li><p>If third party doesn’t return, what kind of degradation will be acceptable?
Would having graceful degradation make sense?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-synchronicity">Data Synchronicity</h3>
<p>Lastly, for systems that are OK with some level of eventual consistency,
we will want to consider how this affects the system
and what sort of delay we would be able to tolerate.
Some questions you may want to ask yourself about the behaviour of your APIs and data entities
related to synchronicity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we have any eventual consistency for data objects that we control? What kind of delay can we tolerate for this?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any interactions between our APIs that need to be <em>in-sync</em>?
ie. API requests dealing with financial balance will likely require more synchronicity than uploading a profile picture.</p></li>
<li><p>Can any of the entities that we control relax their current synchronicity?
(not that we’re necessarily going to do so,
but just that the actual requirements for that object isn’t as strict as it is currently implemented)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wrote this as an exercise to myself for thinking about product limits for one of the projects I’ve lead.
Hopefully someone else will find this useful as well.</p>
<!--- 
Considerations

- Examples given on the program docs just specify entity limits. I’ve included other things like request timeouts and other product related SLA stuff (which arguably are also “product limits”, as it sets expectations on caller). It’s a question on scope… how much do we think these SLAs are important for availability?

_ For APIs that appear on web, we will likely want to follow some of Web’s SLAs (particularly in regards to the response time SLAs). 

_ I’m also thinking that there is not benefit (for us at least) to separating the API based on source that is calling it (ie. web, API, mobile etc). There might be benefits for other high priority apis (like authentication), but for us I think we can look at APIs as generally as possible.

- For newer services, it will be hard to figure out what our limits should be (as we don’t have established usage patterns). So for these, coming up with a limit based off of what we are expecting from the first iteration of the product should be fine. For example, for triage-assist-service, we can probably set our max limit to 20, as the only place where we’re using that service will only need 20 incidents. If the product changes, then we can consider changing this. Otherwise, we can probably also set an arbitrary larger limit (ie. 50), but the most important is that we’ve thought about and have set something relatively reasonable.

    <title>Retrospective on 2022</title>

<p>Wow, time goes by so quickly.
In summary: it was a bad year for crypto-currencies,
social media, Ukraine, Tesla, Pakistan and the climate.
I do hope that there’s finally a reckoning with
unsustainable (North American) car-centric lifestyle
and it’s cost on the climate, mental and physical health,
and maintenance/usage cost
(subsidized by cheap oil
and the fact that infrastructure is fairly new).</p>
<p>As for myself, I got sick a lot this year.
This is what life is like with a toddler in daycare.
However, I never tested positive for COVID
even though I was fairly ill several times this year.
And I’m still recovering from something,
so starting off the new year still mildly sick.</p>
<p>I started writing more in my free time
and made an effort to publish more this year.
I made it more convienient
to jot down notes or blog ideas
by having a shared central location to access my writings across devices,
which was the main reason for my success with publishing more stuff this year.</p>
<p>Early in the year,
I wrote about my laptop being on the verge of explosion.
I ended up giving away that 2015 MBP which was then replaced by a free one that
I got from my job when I quit (2019 MBP).
I also got myself a new Samsung Tablet which I still use a surprising amount.</p>
<p>It’s hard to make a decision on my favourite book this year,
but if I had to narrow it down,
it would be between:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30312747-not-quite-narwhal">Not Quite Narwhal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36748607-p-is-for-pterodactyl">P is for Pterodactyl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54809220-the-rock-from-the-sky">The Rock from the Sky</a> (don’t actually read this to a 2 year old though, it’s kind of scary for them)</li>
</ul>
<p>They all happen to be children’s books,
none of which are at the right level for my toddler.
I’m not sure what that says about me.</p>
<p>The <em>“Great Resignation”</em> was full in effect at the beginning of the year.
However as we approached the end of the year, there were many layoffs.
Even then, I decided to change my job during this time.</p>
<p>I had enjoyed working at my previous company.
The people were great, company was renowned and the projects were mostly interesting.
After a team change at the beginning of the year,
I found myself slipping from being one of the team’s most senior people
(more or less acting as a team lead)
to being right in the middle or on the middle-junior side of the team.
This meant that all the interesting large projects
that I wanted to lead
were slowly becoming out of reach
and be given to those more <em>senior</em> than me
(and I’ll probably be left with smaller projects
at <em>“my level”</em>, due to a slowly creeping title inflation
that left me inflated out).
I decided that to fix this problem,
I would have to either <em>actually</em> work on promotion
(which included compiling a “promo” package
where I write a 10 page document convincing a panel of random peers
that I deserve to be promoted)
or move elsewhere.
Moving elsewhere was apparently much faster and easier.
And my new company also checks off another career bucket list item,
so total win-win.</p>
<p>Lastly, some of my favourite phrases coming from my toddler this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>“water is too wet”</li>
<li>“that was a BIG one”</li>
<li>“RAWR! I lion/tiger/bear”</li>
<li>“no kick mama, kick dada”</li>
<li>“you have a big butt!”</li>
<li>“I love you yellow blankey”</li>
</ul>
