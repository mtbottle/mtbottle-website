<p>It has been a while since I dabbled in art. I had originally wanted to pick up on watercolour as a side hobby (something unrelated to technology) but turned it into generally <em>urban sketching</em> as I had more recently done more ink-only sketching.</p>
<p>Some of the things I learned about watercolour:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is most important to get good paper over paints, brushes etc.</li>
<li>invest time and paper to learn how to mix colours with your palette</li>
<li>how to buy paints (ie. look for transparency and certain pigments codes)</li>
<li>paints and pigments you choose in your palette is subjective, but generally a warm blue, cold blue, warm red, cold red, warm yellow, cold yellow would be enough</li>
<li>red paints are not lightfast and expensive, but I paint in a sketchbook anyways, so don’t really need to care about lightfastness</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things I learned about urban sketching, or drawing in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to get perspectives correct (or at least the importance of perspectives)</li>
<li>drawing in public is hard, so get a smaller sketchbook to not stand out</li>
<li>I don’t need colour to do art, ink is fine too</li>
<li>I don’t need waterproof ink to do art, watersoluble ink works too</li>
<li>keep hair pins in the pencil case to pin up bangs during windy weather</li>
<li>drawing from photo at home works too (or better even)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be interesting to come back to these later and see my improvements over time.</p>
