<p>For my trip to the Maldives, I had decided that I was only going to take a notebook and pen for writing. Part of the reason for this decision was practical; I did not want to carry around a 14“+ laptop that takes up much of my carry-on capacity. And also carrying around my <em>life</em> with me on holiday felt like an unsafe habit that everyone should avoid. So for this trip, I had decided to leave all my technology behind (except my kindle and mp3 player, but I didn’t end up listening to any music anyways) and see how my holiday goes without constant internet connection.</p>
<p>The most suprising adaptation I had to make was with analog writing and documenting of my holiday. There is a sort of romance to writing on paper, especially writing in a leather-bound journal with a fountain pen. But the <em>permanance</em> and lack of ability to edit the writing called for extra forethought on phrasing and event sequencing. And I was completely unused to that. Even as I write this blog entry, I find myself typing out ideas as they come to me, then going back to phrase it better or inserting something that I have forgotten. Perhaps this is associated with the ADD of being constantly bombarded with information? Or maybe this is just an indication of my mental state, where I am just a disorganized, non-linear thinker?</p>
<p>Another adaptation of being disconnected was not having answers for things readily available. Being constantly connected meant that if I wanted to know, for instance, what the traditional Maldivian garbs were called, then I would be able to just look that up on my phone as it occurs to me. Being without internet connection meant that I had to believe that my question was important enough to put the effort into jotting it down to look up later. This changed my relationship with “data” in an interesting way because whether I get information was based on a different barrier to my own laziness (ie. I would look up something on my phone, but too lazy to pull out my notebook to write the question for later). I guess for the sake of practicality, I would more likely have my phone on me than a notebook anyways.</p>
<p>So what will I do for my next holiday? I think <em>not</em> carrying around all my ssh keys, emails, social media accounts and passwords is especially important due to the risks of some bad actor getting that information. Beyond the risk of data theft from losing your device, there’s now also added risk of governments wanting those information. So even though I have disk encryption on all my important devices, it is not safe against coerced unlocking (especially since the guideline is that you <em>must</em> have your devices switched on while going to USA). Although I will avoid going to USA or UK in the foreseeable future, the risk is still there for any cross-border travel. The less you carry, the safer you will be!</p>
<p>Also the slowing down and really thinking through ideas before putting them down is a generally a good thing to have. I can talk about the virtue of patience and “living-in-the-moment”, but I don’t really believe in those (ie. I can’t stand watching a talk/lecture/video at less than 2.5x the speed). I think the the main benefits is just a more thoughtful and less superficial mode of thinking. So if there is any virtue to be instilled here is slowing down for clarity of thought.</p>
<p>So analog writing and documenting of my holiday it is then!</p>
