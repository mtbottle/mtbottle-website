<p>Metricization is the process of measuring a particular thing by proxy through something else that is measurable. So for example, if you want to determine how interesting your blog content is, then one way to determine that is by how many requests you get to your articles. Another example of metricization is measuring “health” by tracking caloric intake or number of steps you take per day.</p>
<p>So the advantages of having a clearly defined metric is that there is a clearly defined way to determine <em>progress</em>. For example, seeing that you are taking more steps per day will feel like you’re making progress to being healthier. It also <em>feels</em> very non-biased because numbers speak for themselves and we know that there is a connection between physical activity and health.</p>
<p>But there are a few problems with this assumption of objectivity. Choice of metric may only show correlation without addressing causation. In our health example, we need to be careful in controlling for other factors that we can measure because you are more likely to walk more because you are healthy and more mobile (rather than the other way around). Therefore we must always be careful with confounding factors.</p>
<p>On top of this, the choice of which factor to control for is a biased choice. We might also choose to control for “caloric intake”, or apple/coffee/chocolate/[insert food here] intake per day, even though there are no really good non-contextual reason to do so. The reason we would choose to focus on one of these over others is because of how it fits our conceptual understanding of “health”. This contextual input in our metric selection is therefore intrinsically biased and not “objective”.</p>
<p>So although it is very easy to fall into the trap of “I’ve got numbers; you can’t dispute numbers”, results and interpretations of the data will always be disputable based on context and framing.</p>
