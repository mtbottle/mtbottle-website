<p>I’m rather sad about it still. But my time in Berlin did not go as expected.</p>
<p>In theory, the city is perfect for me; nice pace of life, city of artists, lots of awesome parks, environmentally conscious, can live without a car and the non-Anglo sense of civic responsibilities (ie. city actually cares and have done something about affordable rent, and the numerous refugee programs across the city). In my 2.5 years here, I really struggled with fitting into Berlin.</p>
<p>There are a few barriers which I can only fault myself. For instance, my lack of conversational German made the parts of the city I wanted to experience, inaccessible. In retrospect, perhaps I should’ve tried harder, continued to take classes and go out more often to make new friends. To be fair, I also struggled to go out and meet people in London and Seattle as well; everyone I became friends with were work colleagues. So the other mistake was perhaps to work for a remote company while living here.</p>
<p>Berlin is awesome in the summer, but I can’t stand the rest of the year. It is cold, wet and the sun barely exists (rises at 9, sets at 15 in the winter, and likely to be cloudy and rainy). I bought myself a daylight lamp which helps. However, 3/4 of the year is crap for that 2-3 months of really great summer, which doesn’t feel like a good deal.</p>
<p>However, the most common reason I give people, which is probably also the truest reason for returning to Toronto is family and friends. I can’t just move my family over to Berlin (although I think their lives will improve if they did), nor do I think they want to leave behind their established life in Toronto. On top of that, Berlin lacks the cultural connections that my family is familiar with. There’s at least a relatively large Chinese-Vietnamese community in Toronto In Berlin, there was maybe one other person in the block that I live in looks to be of non-European origin (probably Vietnamese). Compared to many European cities, Berlin is probably very multicultural. However, compared to Toronto, it’s just not.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after living in so many cities, eventually everything falls into an equilibrium where it no longer matters that it’s <em>that</em> particular city. I suspect going back to Toronto, I might initially indulge in what I enjoy about it and occasionally rage about the lack of good transit access, but it will reach a point where I don’t notice it anymore and it just becomes another city. For instance, I live near parks in Berlin, but I’ve noticed that I’ve stopped going this summer; or I’ve stopped drinking as much cheap beer as when I first moved here. Things will stop being novel, and annoyances will just be another fact of life.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s the family, friends and job that matters. I’m really sad to be leaving, but what I want in my life now cannot be given to me outside of Toronto.</p>
