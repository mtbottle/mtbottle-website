<p>…and I still don’t really know any French. However, learning some French would have been a good idea before the trip. Unlike Montreal, not all signs are translated to English, which forced me to use the rusty ninth grade level French I learned from school. This article is about some of the highlights of my trip to Quebec City from April 5-8 2014.</p>

<h1>
History
</h1>
Since vieux Québec city was built on top of the a cliff, getting to the <a href="www.hihostels.ca/quebec/173/HI-Quebec/">hostel</a> was an uphill climb from the train station which was in vieux-port (lower section of the city which served as the port). It gave me a chance to lament the cardio endurance I had lost from lounging around reading books during my funemployment. After the waves of regret (over numerous things including what to do with my life), I was able to appreciate the strategic location of this city which was built in the 1600s; building on top of a cliff served its intended purposes of keeping people (like me) out of the city and hence naturally helped fortify the city from invasion.
<h1>
Food
</h1>
<p>Considering that I was on a strict[ish] ketogenic diet, I was pretty scared of being able to eat out. I was especially afraid of the pastry temptations as I assumed that Quebec city will most likely be the the North American centre of Parisian confections. Walking along rue Saint-Jean (a touristy, commercial street in vieux Quebec) there weree several shops selling chocolate marshmellows, liquorice, macarons, maple syrup candy, crêpe, delicately-confected brownies and ice cream. None of which I can eat. However not all is lost in terms of ketogenic snacks; cheese curds are sold like chips in random convienience stores and la marché du vieux-port.</p>
One of the evening that we decided to grab chicken wings. We decided to walk out of old Quebec to see if any of the restaurants had chicken wings. But only the St. Hubert on Grande Allée Est had any (and we didn’t want to go there we can find them easily enough in Montreal). So we decided to walk back into the vieux Quebec to find chicken wings. After looking at the menu of countless restaurants, we were about to give up (and get McDonalds dollar menu burgers, and I’ll just strip away the bread) when we found an Irish pub that served chicken wings! The wings were served slghtly differently from our anglophone/american edition of it, but it at least satisfied a craving. But the lesson learned is that chicken wings is not universal among North American pubs (especially in Francophone cuisine).
<h1>
Snow on les Plaines d’Abraham
</h1>
<p>On the first morning in Quebec City, we decided to walk along rue de la Terrasse-Dufferin which was on the corner of le Château Frontenac <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Frontenac">(a famous hotel, which is claimed to be the most photographed hotel in the world)</a>. However, I soon realized that this was a mistake, and a toil I absolutely wish upon my worst enemies. I kept slipping on the worn path of snow or kept sinking into the fresh virginic snow. Ultimately, my calves would take a beating, as I learned in the evening when I could hardly walk due to the latent muscle strain.</p>
<p>The rue de la Terrasse-Dufferin eventually became the Promenade des Gouverneurs, which was much easier to climb because the staircase was clear of snow. Regardless of how adverse I am to strenous exercise, walking up stairs was much easier than on flat stretches of 20cm thick packing snow.</p>
<p>Once we reached the top of the promenade, we arrived in les plaines d’Abraham. From the look of the amount of snow, it was prime skiing condition. In fact, I saw at least 5 people skiing in the park, along with people walking their dogs and strolling their babies… through snow mounds. If it wasn’t for the mounds snow covering the terrain, I think this would’ve been quite a beautiful park. It also gave me an urgency for getting proper shoes for going adventuring (rather than my soon to be smelly, soaked-through and tractionless pair of pumas).</p>
Les plaines d’Abraham was the historical location of many wars which I learned in the <a href="http://www.lesplainesdabraham.ca/en/exhibitions/odyssey/">discovery centre</a> on the north east part of the park. It was the place where the British and French battled for occupation of the city They couldn’t really fight anywhere else due to the city being surrounded on the other three sides by cliff and water. Through the exhibition at the discovery centre, I got a glimpse of more Canadian history than I was able to retain from my tenth grade Canadian history class. It covered everything from the founding of Quebec, the British invasion, abandonment by France, the war with the Americans and up to the founding of Canada. It is a great exhibition for those interested in pre-Canadian history.
<h1>
Ferry across the St.Lawrence
</h1>
In the afternoon, we decided to take the <a href="http://traversiers.com/ferries/quebeclevis_16.php">commuter ferry across the St. Lawrence</a>. For 3.35 one way, this was as frugal a ferry ride as you can get. This was a 10 minute ride over ice pieces floating on the river. There were more of it on the Levis side, which made for an interesting docking technique where the boat will pull up a bit forward like in parallel parking but mainly to block and push away the floating ice pieces. Since Levis didn’t look very happening, we just took the same boat back to Quebec. Compared to the commuter ferry rides I took in Vancouver (to North Van), this was a plus on interesting-floating-things in the water, but minus on location. The best ferry ride I’ve been on is probably the Tsawwassen-Swartz Bay ferry from Vancouver to Victoria ($16.25 for one way, but the ride is over an hour and a half). Regardless of the uneventful ride, I guess crossing the St. Lawrence is more of a historic/heritage/spiritual milestone rather than one for scenic purposes.
<h1>
Parc de la Chute-Montmorency
</h1>
<p>The next morning we decided to go to the <a>Chute-Montmorency</a>, which was a 30 min bus ride from downtown Quebec. This waterfall is boasted to be higher than Niagara Falls which peaked my interest (and fueled my Ontarian patriotism). Again, there was the problem of snow all over the place. This time, I was slightly more prepared with my rubber Tretorn rainboots to deal with the mud and some snow. However I soon realized that they were not meant for walking on soft snow (where you feet rolls over the snow to get traction) because holes started wearing into the rubber exterior (and hence my feet got wet anyways). The gondola advertised in the hostel pamplet also wasn’t running, which was a slight disappointment because it would’ve been quite spectacular. Instead, we got snow covered staircases that were closed off. Many people disregarded the signs anyways and treaded down the stairs and frozen river anyways.</p>
One interesting formation at the bottom of the waterfall is the “sugar loaf” formation, which looked like a tumour at the base of the waterfall. The formation was caused by the spray of the waterfall freezing in a predicatble location. Also, there was a solid ice sheet over the river (I did not walk on it, but saw foot prints of people/animals who dare tread on it). The ice sheet also looked to be several metres above the actual running river.
<h1>
Observatoire de la Capitale and Parliament
</h1>
<p>Coming back to the city, we decided to visit the Observatoire de la Capitale which was advertised (in <a href="http://www.voilaquebec.com/en/accueil/index.html">Voila magazine</a> obtained in our hostel) as the best view of the whole city. The observatoire is located on the top floor of the édifice Marie-Guyart which is an office building with normal office people going about their business in suits. The view was definitely spectacular as we could see across the St. Lawrence and got a good view of the parliament and la citadelle. The cost was about $10, but this included some history lessons as well as the view.</p>
After peaking our interest in the parliament (which was only a block or two away from the observatoire), we chose that as our next destination. We walked along the outside of the parliament building, where there were loads of historical symbols embedded on the outside walls and on the lawn. Again, because of the snow, much of the beauty of the potential flora was masked under 20 cm of snow. The exterior of the building contained many statues of men and women who were important to the founding of la ville de Quebec as well as premiers who have done significant things to shaped the history of Quebec. It made me appreciate how much Quebecers revere their heritage and history (which is something devoid at Queen’s Park in Toronto, which I guess might be too heterogenous for most people to have a shared experience of “Ontario”).
<h1>
Excursion around the wall
</h1>
I was also interested in the wall around vieux Quebec, so after the parliament, we walked along the wall on the inside of the old city. On our excursion, we found out where all the teenagers hang out to smoke pot (don’t worry teenagers, I won’t give out your hiding spot… ok maybe I will). This was either on Porte Kent or Porte St-Jean which use to be fortified entryways into the city. These entryways in a less snow-infested time would’ve been teeming with tourists. It was interesting to juxtapose the seemingly busy tourist destination with the normality of every day teenagers (where else would you hang out in vieux Quebec?) The walk along the wall brought us to the Parc-de-l’Artillerie (Artillery Park Heritage), which was closed for the season. There were also snow covered fake cannons that you can climb (they looked like metal replicas, but was told that they are real… and I’m still skeptical) all along the cliff wall overlooking lower Quebec and the industry along the St. Lawrence. We also passed by the Séminaire de Quebec which is now used by the architecture department of the Université de Laval. Lastly, I have to mention the great view of city lights in the evening while we were walking down rue Saint-Anne. The intersection looking down rue Saint-Angele, which runs downhill, had a phenomenal view of the city lights and the land across the St.Lawrence. The street in the evening makes for the best make-out session turned artsy photography (likely by tourists like me).
<h1>
La citadelle
</h1>
On the last day of our trip, we woke up much earlier than we were accustomed to for the trip to <a href="http://www.lacitadelle.qc.ca/">la Citadelle</a>. La citadelle is a military base on the southwestern part of vieux Quebec that is still run by the military. We briefly visited the base on the previous evening, but were turned away by soldiers who were guarding the entrance. Since this was a military base, the only way to get access to the site was through a guided tour. There were lots of interesting history we learned from la citadelle; this was the original site of the only Francophone battalion in the Canadian army, and that although the British built the fortress as a line of defense against the Americans in the civil war, it was never actually used. Also interestingly, there is a fortress inside the fortress which was built by the British in case of Francophone uprising. Fortunately, neither the Americans nor the Francophones invaded and the citadelle is preserved in its pristine condition today.
<h1>
Notre-Dame de Québec
</h1>
<p>Our last touristy stop for the trip was visiting the Notre-Dame de Québec, which is the most famous basilica in Quebec City. There isn’t much to say about the basilica because it is like any other basilica (with lots of gold, ornaments and donation boxes). We didn’t get a tour of the building (you have to book a tour), so we kind of got the experience of the cathedral on our own. Of things to note, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Door">“holy door”</a> and the crypt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Laval">François de Laval</a> who was the first bishop of Quebec.</p>
This is the end of the Quebec city journey. We took Via Rail back to Montreal in anticipation of Pycon. In the end, the journey was very much catching up on the history that I had forgotten from highschool (although much more enriched) and lots of melting snow and wet feet. Also, we watched the PLQ win a majority government in the provincial election on Monday.
