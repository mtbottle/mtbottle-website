<p>I closed my AirBnb account last week. It was partly because I haven’t really used my personal account since 2012, and haven’t actually used AirBnb after our semi-disasterous stay in London (which I wrote about in 2014). I stood by the company as a better alternative to hotels, but 3 years later and seeing more exploitation by the “sharing/gig economy”, I just can’t justify supporting these companies anymore.</p>
<p>In theory, the concept is brilliant; if you have an extra room, you can rent it out to travellers where the travellers get all the awesome things to do from a local, and the person owning the apartment can meet people from all over the world, as well as making some extra income on the side. However, there are other platforms for that which doesn’t exploit the rental market, like couchsurfing.</p>
<p>The problem comes when “enterprising” landlords decide that they can make more money leasing short term rentals rather than having a proper, long-term tenant. I don’t have an issue with the concept of leasing out a whole apartment (it is a nice way to travel, for those who can afford it), but the supply of this needs to be regulated so that rent in the city stay affordable. Also in many cases, the apartment/room on AirBnb is comparible in price to a similar vacation home or B&amp;B in the same city, but with fewer regulations.</p>
<p>So what then are my alternatives? I have a lifetime membership to <a href="https://www.hihostels.com/">hihostel</a>, but as I get increasingly older, I am also finding <em>socializing</em> with young people tiresome. It is still my first go-to as they are non-profit as I support their mission… but I usually go for private rooms if they have any. Otherwise I try to book guesthouses or B&amp;Bs which I find off of booking.com. I still don’t enjoy staying at hotels, but sometimes they <em>are</em> the cheapest option (yes, cheaper than a private room at the hostel).</p>
<p>So just like how I refuse to use Uber on principle, I’ve just closed my AirBnb account as well.</p>
