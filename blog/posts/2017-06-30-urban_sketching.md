title: Urban Sketching After Four Months
tags: art
---

It has been a while since I dabbled in art. 
I had originally wanted to pick up on watercolour as a side hobby 
(something unrelated to technology)
but turned it into generally *urban sketching* as I had more recently done more
ink-only sketching.

Some of the things I learned about watercolour:

* it is most important to get good paper over paints, brushes etc.
* invest time and paper to learn how to mix colours with your palette
* how to buy paints (ie. look for transparency and certain pigments codes)
* paints and pigments you choose in your palette is subjective, but generally a warm blue, cold blue, warm red, cold red, warm yellow, cold yellow would be enough
* red paints are not lightfast and expensive, but I paint in a sketchbook anyways, so don't really need to care about lightfastness

Some things I learned about urban sketching, or drawing in general:
 
* how to get perspectives correct (or at least the importance of perspectives)
* drawing in public is hard, so get a smaller sketchbook to not stand out
* I don't need colour to do art, ink is fine too
* I don't need waterproof ink to do art, watersoluble ink works too
* keep hair pins in the pencil case to pin up bangs during windy weather
* drawing from photo at home works too (or better even)

It would be interesting to come back to these later and see my improvements over time.
