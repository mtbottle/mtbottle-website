I've been back in Toronto for one year now. 
Since I'm back in North America,
I can't say that I've travelled very much this year.

I did take a short business trip to Ottawa in February.
I got to see Carleton University (for the first time)
and saw the unfinished subway.

The biggest thing to have happened to me is that I changed jobs... again.
There were a couple of reasons why I left the job,
but the 2 main reasons were related to my commute (45 minutes each way)
and a developing fear that I was not technically rounded enough
to adapt to new technologies.
So my new job is now much closer to home
and is primarily using a different technology 
than what I've been programming in the past 6 years. 
I still have in my mind, an idea that I should try working in a consultancy
at some point to get more technical breadth.

I got my piano back this summer. 
I've been learning a few pieces, mostly Debussy and Chopin. 
In particular: Reverie (Debussy), 
Waltz in C# Minor (Chopin) 
Nocturne in Eb Major (Chopin),
and Waltz in Ab Major (Chopin).
Maybe someday I can play the Revolutionary Etude (Chopin) and Clair de Lune (Debussy).

I've also given up on alcohol since October.
The most surprising result from this was that it has saved me a lot of money
(well, it should be obvious considering how expensive alcohol is here).
I also haven't really missed it very much, 
but that's partly because I don't socialize much anymore.
I think I will probably go back to drinking at some point, 
but probably less than I use to drink when living in Europe.

I've also got myself a new smart phone this year.
It's mostly for my new job, which requires me to be oncall regularly.

I also managed to read up to 100 books this year.
Admittedly, it became a pain as I got closer to 100 books. 
My goal is always only 52 books, and I always go past it with a wide margin.
At some point when I reached 80 books this year,
I thought that I should maybe really try to hit 100 books. 
However, I started only reading for the sake of hitting the goal
and found myself _dreading_ reading after my 100th book. 
Anyways, I hope to be less ambitious this year and not pressure myself to read
when I don't feel like it. 

Lastly, the only travelling I did this year was to a resort in Cuba over Christmas.
It was underwhelming; lots of sun, sand and not much else otherwise. 
I regret going over Christmas, as I found that I had wished
that I was with my family instead. 
Anyways, I will probably avoid going to resorts in the future
and probably also not travel over Christmas.

I kind of regret not focusing more on my health this year, 
so maybe I'll try to exercise regularly and eating better.
I also didn't draw or paint much this year. 
Hopefully with the time saved on my commute, 
I will feel motivated to draw again.
