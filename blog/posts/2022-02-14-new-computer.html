            <div class="info">
<em>Posted on February 14, 2022</em>
    
</div>

<p>For the past 5 years, my main computer has been a 15&quot; Macbook Pro. It was the computer that I acquired through work, which I then purchased off of them when I left. For a personal device, it is way over powered. Most of my computer needs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>watching videos</li>
<li>web surfing</li>
<li>online banking</li>
<li>buying stuff online</li>
<li>lightweight editor (mostly to modify markdown files)</li>
<li>ssh for managing various servers</li>
<li>portability for when I went travelling, and/or around the house</li>
</ul>
<p>As my Macbook’s battery is on the verge of explosion, I had the option to re-evaluate my computing options and potentially save some money.</p>
<p>So… what devices do I still have…</p>
<h2 id="my-old-haxxor-lenovo-t420s">My old haxxor Lenovo T420s…</h2>
<p>The first thing I dug into was my old T420s. I shamelessly installed it back in 2016 with Debian and Xmonad. That was back when I actually had time on my hands.</p>
<p>So, coming back to this super custom machine in 2022, I had already forgotten how to use it. Luckily, I wrote a blog article on how I got it to work (like <code>wicd</code> to connect to internet) so I was able to reverse engineer stuff I did to make the computer mildly usable. But it made me think about how I gradually made my Macbook Pro my main computer over time because it <em>just worked</em>.</p>
<p>As I grow older with limited capacity to learn and customize my habits, the mental overhead of these super cool custom things isn’t really worth the time.</p>
<p>Is a tiling window manager cool? Yes. But it’s also extra knowledge that I need to invest time into making a habit. Not to mention that it’s not exactly transferable. Knowing how to use this super customized computer will not translate to knowing how to use any random computer. So, this was a long winded way to say that I’m unlikely to install a TWM again in my next computer.</p>
<p>The other annoyance is that the hard drive is also end of life. It’s an SSD I bought around 2013, and although I stayed up late to reinstall it with a more usable OS, (was super nostalgic… reminded me of late nights waiting for things to work) it still ran too slowly for me. So in order for me to make this work as a main device, I’ll at least need to get a new hard drive.</p>
<p>The last annoyance is that the battery is pretty unusable, so I can’t expect to be able to use it away from a power source. However, at least the machine works without a battery, which is better than the modern laptops/devices that can’t run at all when the battery dies.</p>
<h2 id="my-phone-is-also-a-computer">My phone is also a computer</h2>
<p>Most of my browsing is currently on my phone. Admittedly, my phone is probably powerful enough for most of my everyday computer needs. It is super portable, has a decent browser and I already sometimes use it to play videos and music.</p>
<p>The problem is that my phone screen is annoyingly small for any terminal work. Also, it’s the device that I’m most likely to lose, so I probably don’t want to put too many of my secret keys on it. It’s probably best suited as an emergency backup device.</p>
<h2 id="how-about-my-work-laptop">How about my work laptop?</h2>
<p>My work laptop has too much spyware. So having personal stuff on it is out of the question.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S2</h2>
<p>I inherited this relatively old tablet (2015) earlier this year. I use it mainly to show videos to my toddler. But, there were a few things that I was able to do to make it feel more like a laptop.</p>
<p>I was able to connect my wired ErgoDox keyboard via a micro-USB dongle that we bought many years ago.</p>
<p>Development apps need to be downloaded via F-droid. The apps downloaded through Google Play didn’t work due to Google’s weirdness around permissions.</p>
<p>But I was able to get SSH access through Termux, and draft this blog article via GitJournal. I can upload this blog article to my GitHub Pages site by using <code>mgit</code> and do random code fixes via Acode. So current status: can blog.</p>
<p>The only downsides of this tablet is that the battery life is pretty bad (that was exactly the reason why the original owner gave it to me). Also, I can’t charge it on my desk because I don’t have a micro-USB cable that is long enough to go from my desk to the power outlet. So I need to make sure the tablet is charged before I to use it for an extended amount of time.</p>
<p>The tablet also can’t multitask as well as a computer, which can be a plus or minus. It helps create focus, but is also annoying if I want to do many things at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>My Macbook Pro is eligible for a free battery replacement. So I took it to the Apple Store to get it replaced. However, the part needs to be ordered internationally, so it’ll be a few weeks until it can be fixed.</p>
<p>At the moment, using the tablet is good enough for my usual usage. But it’s probably not going to be sufficient for the long term. Or at least I need more time to see how it pans out.</p>
<p>I’m probably due for a computer upgrade anyways. In all likelihood, I’m probably going to go for whatever new Macbook Air comes out this year.</p>
