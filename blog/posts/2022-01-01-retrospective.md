COVID is still a thing.
It has dampened any motivation (but not desire, unfortunately) to travel.
I’ve been finding myself browsing travel blogs at various times during the year.

I started off the year still on parental leave, and headed back to work in March. 
Although I enjoyed my time with my baby, it was somewhat of a relief to go back to work.

The COVID deniers, antivaxxers, antimaskers have made me lose faith in humanity.
On the plus side, we have a fairly OK vaccination rate in Canada.
We should really send our surplus vaccines to countries that have shortages.

I’m learning Chinese and have reached about HSK 3.
I stalled here because I’ve already finished Duolingo
and haven’t really had motivation to continue with my Chinese textbooks.
I bought a bunch of graded Chinese readers, which I’ve been going through slowly.
我因该学多中文，但是我没有时间。
我的孩子有太多精力， 所以我每天就得很累了。

I read [Staff Engineer by Will Larson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56481725-staff-engineer),
and that motivated me a bit career wise.
It’s hard to focus on it when my toddler keeps getting sick from daycare.
The paediatrician said that it will be like this for the first year of daycare/school.

I’ve been neglecting my blog.
I wrote some articles that I posted internally to company wiki.
Maybe I'll sanitize those and add them to my personal blog as well.
They are mainly about risk and project management.

I’ve also been neglecting my health, and the Christmas sweets aren't helping.

I managed to read 70 books this year.
My favourite is [Llama Llama Wakey Wake](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11737287-llama-llama-wakey-wake).

Parenting a toddler is surprisingly fun.
But I'm glad I get to stick them in daycare.

I didn't do much in terms of side projects.
I migrated this blog to using GitHub Actions to deploy
(rather than my copying the build files into a dedicated repo).
I'm impressed that I managed to find the time to do that at all this year.

I bought a homeless person a coffee one day,
and another homeless person meals from McDonalds on another day.
Handing out cash might be more useful, but I don't usually keep cash on me.

I didn’t end up catching omicron COVID,
even though I was constantly in a sick cycle with my toddler
starting from September.
However, we managed to get a booster before year end.
Yay.
