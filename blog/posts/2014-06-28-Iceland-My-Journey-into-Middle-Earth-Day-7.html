<p>We actually managed to wake up early at 6 today, and was able to set out to Dynjandi waterfall at 8:30 am. However before we got to the waterfall, we found an “indie” hot spring just about 10 minutes outside of Bildadular. The hot spring was essentially a warm swimming pool. I wanted to swim in it, but decided against it (long day).</p>

More Gisli Saga
</h1>
<p>Along the way, we also found a folkloric infoboard for Gisli and Audur’s dealings with Eyjolfur the Gray along with Gisli’s last stand.</p>

<h1>
Dynjandi!
</h1>
<p>Dynjandi was a beautiful component waterfall. It was a bunch of waterfalls but the main cascade one is called Dynjandi.</p>

Driving on the plateau and Karlinn stone man
</h1>
<p>Some of the roads in the western fjords were closed because they were still covered in snow.</p>

<p>Also along route 60 we passed by another statue named the Karlinn stone man. This is another one of those monuments built by the road construction workers in their free time.</p>

<h1>
Finding Flókatóftir
</h1>
<p>On our way back, we decided to find Flókatóftir again (we consulted the internet maps at the hostel in the previous evening). It was supposedly just around the ferry terminal at Vatnsfjörður (like literally right next to the terminal). The port had a strong fishy smell and virtually no one around. We stopped there and [think we] finally found the remnants.</p>

There were no signs, no museums, just a couple of ruins. I thought that this made the experience more authentic.
<h1>
Another small indie hotspring
</h1>
<p>We also stopped by another small hot spring. This one was fairly hidden, so I will keep it that way (of course the savvy hacker can figure out the location).</p>

Cute small hotspring that can maybe fit up to 10 people.

<h1>
Eiríksstaðir
</h1>
On the way back, we decided to stop at Eiríksstaðir, which is a [replica] historical viking house. It is near the archaeological ruins of Eiríkur Þorvaldsson’s house (Eirik the red). As you may have well seen by now, this place was closed for the season. It is only opened from June 1st to August 31st. <img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bpOHGJZgFoY/U2gUdfw-X6I/AAAAAAAAExo/vAogkK5GSX4/w889-h667-no/IMG_20140505_153122.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>
<p>Eirik the red is famous for being one of the first settlers on Greenland. However, modern evidence suggests that there were possibly other Nordic explorers who found Iceland before him.</p>

<h1>
Back to Keflavík and end of Journey
</h1>
<p>We finished driving around the ring road (there is a toll road between Eiríksstaðir and Reykjavík). Our journey ends at Keflavík, where we had a fancy stay in a hotel (rather than a hostel). At the end of our journey, the only food we had left were avocados and part of a Camembert, so dinner in our last night in Iceland was less than satisfactory for such an amazing trip.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I wish we didn’t rush the trip as much. Next time we go (maybe in the winter? to go see the northern lights), I think we will choose one “quadrant” of the island and explore the area a bit more.</p>
<p>Until next time… (I’ve got other topics queued up to be written…)</p>
