The year was generally pretty terrible.
The economy sucks, and it's going to probably get worse.
There's still unnecessary war in the world.
There's still existential angst about the climate.
I've been avoiding reading the news.

Anyways, after a wave of layoffs
and feeling like I wasn't making any _progress_
with the initiatives that I've started,
I decided to switch companies in the spring.
It was the right decision. No regrets.

I was seriously burned out in my previous job,
and didn't realize how bad it was until I left the company.
I was sick for a whole month after I quit.

I am amused (sad? dreading?) to admit that I've actually started using AI to help me code.
I was skeptical about the technology (still am mostly) last year,
but search results has been getting shittier
and have been fairly useless.
It is much faster to just ask AI the question,
then verify via official documentation or running the generated code.

In terms of reading, there wasn't anything that was particularly memorable this year.
I was trying to improve my Chinese by reading a bunch of graded readers.
And I've got a new e-reader which is Android based,
which means that I can install Pleco to read books.
If I had to choose my favourite reads this year, the highlights were:

- A poetic translation of the [Dao De Jing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205478817-dao-de-jing)
- [Ten Ways to Get Dumpted by a Tyrant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63029823-ten-ways-to-get-dumped-by-a-tyrant) because it was the most funny thing I've read all year. The sequels were meh though.
- [Devil Venerable Also Wants to Know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59066963-devil-venerable-also-wants-to-know), fun danmei which is also a satire on the xianxia cultivation romance genre.
- [The Invisible Life of Addie Larue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue)

By the end of the year, I also got interested in writing my own Wuxia novel.
It's kind of fun to write stories again,
especially when there are no expectations.

I've been an urbanist for all of my adult life.
And this year, my partner convinced me to go to more municipal consultations
(especially in support for a bike lane route in my neighbourhood).
Then later in the year, we started going to bike lane protests.
The government decided to use "bike lanes" as a culture war issue
(to bypass due diligence for seizing land to build another highway,
but that's another story)
and will be ripping out some very heavily used bike lanes.
It's hard for me to not feel like my efforts are futile
and that I should just move to Europe.
And to my NIMBY neighbours who don't want to add bike lanes
but also complaining about the increasing amount of car traffic
that is routed through their local streets:

> THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE CAR TRAFFIC
> IS TO PROVIDE VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING.
> (this includes adding more bike lanes to make cycling safer)

Again, my goals for this year remain:

- Read 52 books
- Fix something related to my health
- Try to be less angry. Stop reading the news.
