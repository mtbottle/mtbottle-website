<em>Posted on January  1, 2024</em>

<p>It’s been an interesting year of tech layoffs, bad economy, generative AI, endless wars and more effects of climate change
(record highs in many places?).
I don’t really know what else to make of this year, other than it mostly wasn’t great, and that I generally avoided the news
(and X, the site formerly known as Twitter).
I’m still relatively fortunate though.
At least we’re not living in war, I’m still employed and climate change has not decimated my city yet.
So overall, I would say that this year has been pretty good for me.</p>
<p>In the spirit of avoiding things, I started avoiding <em>reading</em> this year.
By the last quarter of the year, I was super stressed from work and started craving <em>escapism</em>,
which meant that I would sacrifice sleep to read some pretty bad romance novels.
I would regularly read a book until 3 a.m which meant that I would be randomly napping between meetings the next day.
So I just stopped reading novels altogether since I’ve already hit my reading goal of the year.
In general, it was kind of a slump of a reading year, with most of my favourite books read in the first half.
Some highlights (in no particular order):</p>

<p>Speaking of stress from work, I might have been pushing myself too hard this year.
I wanted a Staff Engineer title, changed my job last year to get it, and now I’m stressed out.
Anyways, I’ll try to be more realistic about the number of “side-quests” that I pick up next year.
I spoke at an internal work conference, so that checks off a career bucket-list item.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed search results (from Google, Duckduckgo) getting shittier this year.
But it’s only because I now work for an <em>internet</em> company that I’ve noticed.</p>
<p>I’ve never tested positive for COVID before,
and have generally been very diligent with wearing a mask.
I’ve also being vaccinated and boosted when I get the opportunity.
But I somehow tested positive with COVID for the first time this year.
It might not be the first time I actually contracted COVID,
especially given the sensitivity of the test is not very great.
COVID also robbed me of my opportunity to attend the <em>last Strangeloop ever</em>.
I’m still a bit bummed about it.</p>
<p>I had spent a lot of money and time on fountain pens this year.
I started using a fountain pen around 2015 or 2016 with a Lamy Safari and had most of my pens gifted to me.
My main everyday carry combination for the longest time was a TWSBI Eco-T inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Ama-iro.
This year I really expanded my collection, especially after I discovered Aliexpress
and a whole new world of cheap (but good quality) Chinese fountain pens.
So, here is an updated selection of my favourite pens and inks:</p>
<ul>
<li>TWSBI Diamond 580 with White Rosegold inked with Ferriswheel Press Writing Desk</li>
<li>Majohn A2 inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Konpeki</li>
<li>Opus 88 Demo in Sapphire inked with Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo</li>
<li>Penbbs 355 Galaxy inked with Ferriswheel Press Stroke of Midnight</li>
<li>Platinum Plaisir inked with Platinum Carbon Black</li>
<li>Majohn C4 inked with Jacques Herbin’s Emerald of Chivor.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also haven’t done much travelling this year.
Planning trips with a toddler is a major pain,
so the only trip that I took was a work trip to Montreal
(in which I returned home early because of COVID exposure…
it was not the same COVID that I eventually got).
Do I wish to travel more in the next year?
Maybe. But I’ve been struggling with the effects of air travel on the climate,
as well as the changes to the way I travel to accomodate a child.</p>
<p>I played a lot of piano this year.
Most of the stuff that I played were “by-ear”.
So, transcribing various nursery rhymes (then turning them evil by switching to minor key
or jazzing them up in the bossa nova style).
I also re-explored my roots with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh_C%C3%B4ng_S%C6%A1n">Trịnh Công Sơn</a>
and my childhood with some sheet music that I found in my parents house
(mostly video game music transcriptions).
I’m always going to be an amateur because I never take the <em>practice</em> seriously.
It’s all for my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>I spent the remaining holiday days at the end of the year backing up some CDs from my youth.
Looking at relics of my past was unexpectantly nostalgic, and also kind of sad.
I also wonder how my child will think about the idea of backing up stuff with CD/DVDs.
In fact, it’s pretty incredulous that this was how I did it back in 2004 to 2007.
It was certainly cheaper to get a set of 50 empty disks than buy a harddrive
(of which, I neither had the skills, money, nor equipment to actually use at the time).</p>
<p>In terms of New Year Resolution, I guess the only thing that I’ve been meaning to do more of is look after my health.
I haven’t exercised, and have been eating pretty poorly.
Exercise will be hard to fit into my schedule (and it’s hard to motivate yourself to do something you hate,
especially if you’ve got a stressful job, parenting responsbilities, and living through a rough economy),
but maybe I can fix my diet.
And I should learn Chinese more seriously by taking online classes.
And maybe also draw and paint more.</p>
