<p>I have been basically living under a rock for the last six months and hence only heard of Interstellar after it had been out for about 2 weeks. I had enjoyed most, if not all of Christopher Nolan’s movies (especially Memento, The Dark Knight Rises and Inception), so of course I also had to watch this movie. In short, it was a great movie and definitely worth watching, but perhaps not as great as some of Nolan’s other films.</p>

<h1>
The Review
</h1>
<p>Interstellar is set in a pre-dystopic future on earth where crops are failing (presumably through drought and fire) and dust storms are destroying people’s livelihood. Society has not collapsed, but emphasis has been placed on sustenance of mankind over scholarly or mind-expanding pursuits. Cooper (played by Matthew <span class="itemprop">McConaughey) is a trained engineer/space pilot of whom is forced to become a farmer as society has displaced such professions with those that are more beneficial for sustaining humanity. He is gritty and disgruntled by playing the menial part of a farmer while longing for the “larger” vision for humanity. One day, Cooper and his daughter, Murph (played by multiple people…), comes across a message in the dust (along with other unexplainable things happening, which Murph coined to be caused by a “ghost”). The message were the coordinates for the hidden underground NASA office. At NASA he learns about a wormhole near Saturn that leads to a different universe and their previous missions to scope out habitable planets for humanity to relocate. He is recruited to join the mission as they had no trained pilots.</span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">Murph believes that Cooper has abandoned her when he leaves on the mission. She harbours this resent well into adulthood. Cooper, who gets snapshots of their lives through the video transmissions that gets sent, sees this and also feels remorse for not resolving their relationship before going on the mission. The ending of the movie resolves this conflict in a slightly supernatural way (not to give out too many spoilers, but Murph’s ghost not a completely supernatural figure). I was slightly bothered by the scientific liberties they took to resolve this plotline. </span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">The main organizer of the mission is Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) and his daughter Brand (played by Anne Hathaway). They explain that their intention is for humanity’s survival (which of course is never that simple) and presents the 2 plans of the mission; plan A is to scout out the planets then eventually have people from earth move, and plan B is to start rebuilding humanity and life from DNA samples. I found the exploration between caring for humanity’s survival and caring for the survival of loved ones interesting, especially around the dichotomy with the professor and his daughter. Professor Brand is stated to have given up his own humanity for that of the survival of humanity, as he lied to both his daughter and Cooper to get them to cooperate to seed a new planet. Brand, on the other hand, would give up on humanity’s survival to verify that the man she loves is still alive. Then there is Dr. Mann (played by Matt Damon), who stopped caring for humanity once he realizes that he is alone and only cares about his own survival. These exploration of survival, love and humanity was a suitable winter reflection about my place in the universe. </span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">One of the interesting challenges that the astronauts had to face was the fact that because of relativity (and biostatis), the astronauts experience time shorter than the people back on earth. And this effect is amplified as they get closer to a black hole. For example, Cooper spending a couple of hours scouting a planet that was relatively close to a black hole led him to miss 24 earth years. In this respect, the mission was further complicated by the fact that they had to get the information back to earth before humanity becomes extinct on earth. </span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">Although I loved the themes explored and the timey-wimey challenges, I thought the ending was somewhat flawed because it was overly sentimental and optimistic (Cooper survives… but somehow only ends up 100 years in the future after visiting the event horizon… and humans are living on space habitats, when only 100 years before earth was undergoing economic calamity… and he somehow resolves the conflict with Murph who is somehow still alive… how did this happen?). But then again, if I was to end this movie (or movies in general), I would probably turn everything into a tragedy… which I guess might have left a bad taste for most people. </span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">Then there is the flaw about the science. From my understanding, not all physicists/mathematicians agree with our concept of time being the 4th physical dimension. It would have been great if they explored this concept further in the movie and got rid of the mystical explanation of the 5th dimension. Although I enjoyed the imagination of how the 5th dimension might be perceived in 3 dimensions, not having a coherent structure to understand it left me a bit skeptical about how it was projected. </span></p>
<p><span class="itemprop">Even though the movies had some flaws, I enjoyed it greatly overall. So in conclusion, I would definitely recommend Interstellar as an exploration into human psyche and the concept of time and destiny. </span></p>
