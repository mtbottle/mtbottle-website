            <h1>Holiday in the Scottish highlands: Inverness</h1>

            <div class="info">
<em>Posted on January  1, 2015</em>
    
</div>

<p>I have fallen into an existential crisis for the last couple of weeks. It is partly to do with the holidays and also partly because I was getting into a comfortable routine and felt like I was losing my sense of purpose. Anyway, to deal with my sudden wave of depression [other than drowning myself in excessive alcohol] I decided to do some solo travelling to “get in touch with myself” again and sort myself out. So this is my blog entry about travelling to Inverness from December 27th 2014 to December 31st 2014.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Inverness is located in the northern Scottish highlands on the Ness river. The prefix “Inver-” is the Scottish Gaelic word for entrance or mouth, which makes Inverness literally <em>the mouth of the river Ness</em>. Since Inverness is in the Scottish highlands, this area is traditionally where you get the stereotypical kilt-wearing, bagpipes playing Scots (versus the <em>lowland</em> Scots in Edinburgh and Glasgow, where kilts and bagpipes were not part of their tradition). It is most well known for being in the proximity of Lochness, where you “can” find the Lochness monster.</p>
From London, there is one train daily that runs up to Inverness directly. I was supposed to have taken that train, but since construction work around Kings Cross station was still ongoing, it messed up all the train schedules for the day. What I ended up doing was taking a train to Edinburgh and then transferring to another train to Inverness. There are many more trains running from Inverness to Edinburgh (and subsequently, more trains from Edinburgh to London as well), so the transfer was not too bad. Unfortunately, due to train clusterfuck, I gave up my seat to an elderly woman and basically stood in the stalls for about 4 hours on my way up to Edinburgh.
<h1>
Walking To the Ness Islands (but not in)
</h1>
<p>One of the highlighted things to do in Inverness is to stroll along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ness_Islands">Ness Islands</a>. The Ness Islands are a group of islands to the south of Inverness city centre which gives you a natural getaway from the city. I originally went there on a particularly cold day (December 28) and parts of it was closed.</p>

<p>I walked the long way around and managed to get on the islands on the other side. It was quite icy and I almost slipped on the trail several times. There was a playground and park on the other side which connected to the islands.</p>

<p>The walk was particularly nice as I was out on a cold day, so there weren’t many tourists or people walking about. Since the sun was also quite low all day (because winter and high latitude) it felt sombre and gave a sense of solitude that I was looking for.</p>
<h1>
Inverness Castle and Evening Stroll
</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_Castle">castle</a> was actually built in 1836 on the site of where the ancient castle was supposed to be.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Since the castle was not opened to the public (they are using it as a sheriff courthouse  now), I was not able to go in. Just outside the castle, there is a statue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_MacDonald">Flora MacDonald</a> who was a Jacobite herione who saved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Prince_Charlie">Stuart King</a> during the Jacobite wars.</p>

<p>Before coming to Inverness, I had read that Scottish Gaelic was essentially a dying language except in remote villages far to the north. However, all throughout the city you will find attempts to revive the language by having bilingual signs. I found this particularly fascinating as it destroyed my misconception about the Gaelic language.</p>
<p>Since the castle was built on a hill overlooking the River Ness, it offered a great view of the town.</p>

<p>After I finished strolling around the castle, I walked along the river to the North. Since Inverness is a small town, most shops closes around 6pm and the streets clears of people. However, they still had Christmas decorations up, which gave me great photo opportunities.</p>

The beautiful Christmas lighting and the emptiness of the streets provided a nostalgic atmosphere which was conducive to contemplation.
<h1>
Lochness and Urquhart Castle
</h1>
<p>Who goes to Inverness without visiting Lochness? Since I don’t drive (and have no license to drive), I had to depend on either public transport, walk or take tour buses to get to see all the touristy places. So I opted to take a <a href="http://www.jacobite.co.uk">tour bus/cruise</a> to discover the Lochness.</p>

<p>Lochness is the largest body of water in the United Kingdom (more than all of England and Wales combined). It is situated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Glen_Fault">Great Glen Fault</a> which allows it to be so deep. Of course, the lake is most famous for the legend of the Lochness monster (which I didn’t see on the lake). Part of the tour I purchased let me pass by the <a href="http://www.lochness.com">Lochness Monster Visitor Centre </a>which provides insight into the legend.</p>
<p>Also as part of the tour package, I got to explore the ruins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urquhart_Castle">Urquhart Castle</a>. This was a castle situated right on Lochness at a point that offers strategic military position (kind of like Castle de Chillon in Switzerland… which I haven’t written about yet).</p>

<p>During the 18th and 19th century, the landowners of the area around Lochness (given to the Grant family clan) instigated the highland clearance, which forced highlanders living around the area to be stripped of their homes and be shipped to America. This explains why the archetypal image of the Scottish highlands are images of sheep pastures rather than farms or villages (because land owners thought it was more economical to raise sheep than let people farm). The highland clearances also had other cultural effects on Scottish highlanders, which includes changing the whole social dynamic in the highlands from clan system of governance to that of land ownership. The mass exodus of the highlanders also explains the prominence of Scottish surnames in North America (ie. “Canadian Canadians” often will have a Scottish surname as their ancestors generally were brought there from the highland clearances… which made this a thing).</p>

<p>The castle was originally built in the 12th or 13th century. However, in the 17th century, the Scottish parliament ordered that the castle be destroyed so that the Jacobites do not overtake it and use it as a fortress. It has been in ruins since then.</p>

To fully appreciate Inverness’ history, you have to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism">Jacobite Uprising</a>. It was a movement started in the 1600s to restore a Roman Catholic King of England, Scotland and Ireland after he was vindicated by the English parliament (and stripped of his title as king). This was a time when there was forced religious participation for the [primarily Roman Catholic] highlanders to attend Anglican church. Therefore, this instigated a civil war in the highlands (and other parts of Scotland and Ireland) to rebel against the ruling power.
<h1>
Live Scottish Music At Hootenanny
</h1>
<a href="http://www.hootanannyinverness.co.uk">Hootenanny</a> is a popular pub that plays traditional Scottish music every night at 21:30. I went there on the evening of the 29th, and there was a duo playing (guitar and fiddle) some great Celtic music. They were joined in with an accordionist about halfway through. What I especially liked about the pub was the mix of tourist and locals; I was partly expecting this pub to be overrun by tourists, but it ended up being mostly locals who were in the pub. Because of that, the pub had a true <em>pub-like</em> feeling (people were chatting and drinking beer). There were some clear tourists (including me), but overall the pub had more locals than tourists. It might have also been because Inverness is not really a tourist trap in the middle of winter (maybe come again in the summer and it will be overrun by tourists). The music ended near midnight, with the finale being a catchy song which got people literally dancing.
<h1>
Food of Great Britain
</h1>
For the holidays, I decided to stop keto (temporarily) so that I could eat tasty food (Christmas cakes, see <a href="https://twitter.com/mtbottles/status/547375401329520641">tweet</a>) over the holidays. Since I was off the diet, I decided to try distinctively British food that I would not have been able to eat on my special diet.
<h2>
Haggis
</h2>
<p>Since I was in the Scotland, I had to try the iconic food of the Scots. I had my haggis served on mash potatoes and a piece of grilled chicken. I found it quite tasty (although it was not served in the sheep stomach I was expecting). I do not know how authentic it was, but it ended up being quite tasty.</p>

</figure>
<h2>
Cornish Pasty
</h2>
I passed by a <a href="http://www.properpasty.co.uk">Proper Pasty Co.</a> (yes, a chain I know…) in the middle of town and tried a traditional Cornish steak and potatoes pasty. It reminded me of meat pies and was also quite tasty. Since I had originally wanted to go to Cornwall for the holidays (didn’t work out because couldn’t find an HI hostel that I could easily get to without driving), I thought this was very fitting that I ate some Cornish food.
<h1>
Ship Staircase to the Caledonian Canal (and Ness Islands part 2)
</h1>
<p>One of the major infrastructure built in the Scottish highlands is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Canal">Caledonian Canal</a>. It is a canal that was supposed to let ships connect the eastern ocean with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_William,_Scotland">Fort Williams</a>. It spans 97 km and provided employment for those displaced during the highland clearances. At the mouth of the canal, there was a “ship staircase” infrastructure which allows for ships to slowly rise to the water level of the canal.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Kind of hard to see, but there are a series of “steps”, or locks that the ship has to pass through to get to the actual canal

<p>Here is an info-board showing up it works:</p>

</figure>
<p>The trail along the canal unfortunately extends quite far (and I did not have the energy to walk the whole thing… especially in cold weather and carrying a laptop). So I walked along the canal all the way around back to the Ness Islands. I noticed that the islands were opened, so I took a stroll through them.</p>

<p>Since the day was nicer, there were more people taking a stroll through the islands. But it was still pretty and quiet nevertheless.</p>
<h1>
Journey’s Ending
</h1>
<p>After experiencing the quiet town of Inverness and taking solitary strolls along the various parks and castles, my holiday has come to an end. I don’t think I really cure my depressive mood, but taking a solo trip provided me a chance to reassert my independence and opened me up to meeting new people and finding human connections with random strangers.  I think all the quiet moments walking through beautiful natural scenery and historical monuments provided me with the distractions away from my existential crisis to let me just experience life rather than worry about intangibles.</p>

<h2>
What was I missing?
</h2>
Some things that might be of interest in Inverness that I missed (because of lack of transportation or lack of interest):
<ul>
<li>
Culloden Battlefield, site of the battle which ended the Jacobite Uprising
</li>
<li>
Discovering the various churches in the city
</li>
</ul>
