<p>I haven’t written that much in 2016. Looking through my kanboard, I have several drafts of things I wanted to write, but in the end thought that they might be too controversial or felt incomplete. So I’ve decided to do a vanity review of my year to make up for not publishing enough.</p>
<p>I had quit my job in London at the beginning of the year and applied for a remote position on whim. All that said, remote work is pretty awesome. Since the company is in Germany, I also get a Blue Card visa to Deutschland! (was going to apply via working holiday, but yay!)</p>
<!-- Commented out because too personal 
My one year experiment in a polyamorous relationship ended sometime in the first half of the year.
It was inevitable and I'm beginning to doubt that this type of relationship works for me.
Perhaps I'm being idealistic, but I don't want to give up on the idea.

<p>Moving to Berlin was probably the highlight of my year. I moved to Berlin in April, which was just in time for the nicest time of year. Berlin had more of an <em>artsy</em> vibe which is a nice change to the corporate sink-or-swim of London. I spent much of my summer in Tempelhofer Feld, Treptower Park, Mueggelsee, Five Elephant and Two-and-two. Beer is also ridiculously cheap compared to other countries I’ve lived in.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the relaxed atmosphere in Berlin, I drew more in the summer. I even created a deviant art account, 10 years after it was cool.</p>
<p>Ich habe einen Deutschkurs bei VHS angefangt. Aber nach dem Kurs koennte ich noch kein Deutsch sprechen. Der Kurs wuerde mir besser gefallen, ob es naeher zu mir war und weniger Grammatik hatte.</p>
<p>Going back to Toronto in September was very nostalgic. I had always wanted to live in a box in the sky (lower Spadina), and even toyed with the idea of moving back to Toronto after Berlin.</p>
<p>Our Iceland trip was, once again, pretty awesome. I have now found my new favourite part of Iceland (hint: Krossneslaug). We had visited many hotsprings and saw the ghost of some northern lights. However, it is now more touristy than the first time I visited in 2014, which was kind of annoying. Perhaps next year we should go to Norway to get our filling of fjords.</p>
<p>I tried intermittent fasting by skipping breakfast. However, I re-introduced carbs back into my diet and gained about 2~3 kg. I want to lose that (probably going back to keto) before going to the Maldives in March.</p>
<p>I’m getting more and more jaded with the idea of going back to school for graduate studies.</p>
<p>Weinachtsmaerkte in Germany are awesome. I visited the one in Nuremberg and drank too much Gluehwein. The ones in Berlin were more like carnevals (but still nice to walk through). Next year I’m going to try to go the one in Dresden.</p>
<p>We managed to get tickets to the Chaos Communication Congress. I was conflicted as to whether I wanted to go because I have not been enjoying going to tech meetups or conferences recently. I guess… I don’t regret my decision to have gone. The best “talks” (in my opinion) were the self-organized sessions on more philosophical topics. Of highlight to me, “ComputerSaysNo” (about technology and capitalism leading to the feeling of alienation) and “Eris Rising” (how to invalidate a movement/ideology by splitting apart the community). I might write more about these talks, as I have notes and some refutations. We even managed to hack the system and get 3 people in with 2 tickets, but that’s to be expected: hacking the hacking conference.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-want-to-do-next-year">Things I want to do next year</h2>
<p>So for the next year, I think I’ll make 2 small goals (SMART goals anyone?).</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish <em>something</em> on my blog every month</li>
<li>Get to B2/C1 level of German</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I’ll continue with my read one book a week challenge on Goodreads as well as my unspecific goal/idea of travelling more (let’s hit the bucket list of visiting every continent).</p>
