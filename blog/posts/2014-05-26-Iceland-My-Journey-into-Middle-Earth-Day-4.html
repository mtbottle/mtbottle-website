<p>We were lucky that we had another sunny day in Iceland.</p>

Leaving Seyðisfjörður and restocking supplies in Egilsstaðir
</h1>
<p>Since it was a beautiful day we took our time getting back to Egilsstaðir to restock.</p>

</figure>
<p>There was also a runic monument on route 93 (that we didn’t spend much time on in the previous evening because we were rushing to get to the hostel at a reasonable hour). We didn’t know what the monument was for, but from numerous google searches, it looks like a monument to Þorbjörn Arnoddsson for pioneering winter transportation.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
We then took route 93 back to Egilsstaðir (civilization) where there were numerous grocery markets to choose from. Also one thing to note was the number of hitchhikers we saw coming into Egilsstaðir. It seems like hitchhiking from Egilsstaðir to Akureyri is very common.
<h1>
Drive along Jökulsá á Brú and seeing Askja
</h1>
<p>Driving west of Egilsstaðir, we drove along Jökulsá á Brú which is a river valley leading away from the glacier. The sun and the valley gave for some very scenic pictures.</p>
<figure>

So much sun! Also trees!

<figcaption>
The river was suprisingly narrow (considering how much space riverbed that was exposed).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Leading out of the valley, the elevation rose and we were back into cold plain plateau.</p>

<figcaption>
After so many mountains, empty plains of snow was a nice contrast.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since this part of the journey was on a part of the ring road facing Askja (the famous volcano in the centre of Iceland), there were some great scenic points facing Askja.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
You can see Askja on the left (the mountian that is covered with snow admist the dark evil looking volcanic mountains). Askja is also noticably “flatter” on top, probably because that is where the volcanic crater resides.

<h1>
Dettifoss and getting lost
</h1>
<p>Our original plan for the day was to go to Dettifoss (supposedly the most powerful waterfall in all of Europe) from route 864. However, we found out the morning of that the road was closed (seasonally) and we had to change our plan to come in from route 862 instead (which also meant we couldn’t go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81sbyrgi">Ásbyrgi canyon</a> either). We had also missed the road into 862 by 20 minutes (the intersection from ring road was terrible, but the hitchhiker standing there should have gave us notice). We did eventually back-tracked and got to Dettifoss.</p>
<p>Dettifoss was admist a lot of snow. The trail that led to the waterfall itself was completely snow covered (I was prepared this time with proper hiking/snow boots!).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
So much snow around Dettifoss!
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The waterfall itself reminds me a lot of Niagara Falls, probably because it makes a sort of horse-shoe shape. Since we came in from route 862, we didn’t see the main “touristy” view of Dettifoss which would’ve been on the other side through route 864.</p>

<h1>
Chinese-medicine smelling Námafjall Hverir mudpools
</h1>
<p>After passing Dettifoss, we were entering south of the Krafla <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera">caldera</a>. Caleras are formed by soil instability after a volcanic eruption (which creates a crater in the land which may or may not be covered by a lake). Due to the soil instability, the area around the caldera is open to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumarole">fumaroles</a> (which are gassy fissures in the land that expell sulphur dioxide or other gases trapped in the magma). To the south of the Krafla (and along the ring road), there was a set of fumarole mudpools called Námafjall Hverir.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ketGUYFEoXs/U2Q3t3ObcRI/AAAAAAAAC9Q/dbPjHpdwjso/w889-h667-no/IMG_20140502_170334.jpg" alt>

A steaming hot spring.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When fumarole gas mix in with water, it creates an acidic solution that dissolves the surrounding soil into the water, creating a steaming mudpool. Not only does it smells of sulphur (hot springs also smell of sulphur), because the acid is creating a reaction with the surrounding soil, the scent was much stronger than it was in Haukadalur. In fact, there was a hint of Chinese medicine smell in the area that was slightly overwhelming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
For some reason the mud in the mudpool is grey while the surrounding “older” dirt is brownish-yellow.

<h1>
Trek along Mývatn
</h1>
<p>Since we figured that we were making good progress for the day, we decided that we could drive around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BDvatn">Mývatn</a> lake with our extra time. Mývatn is a lake that is in the Krafta caldera (not far from the volcano itself). It is also a very popular tourist attraction for native Icelanders (for the hot spring that we did not go to, and for the wildlife that surrounds the lake). There was a short trail to the south east of the lake where we decided to take an evening stroll.</p>

<figcaption>
The spring trees look really nice in the early evening light.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From where we were located on the lake, we could see lots of little islands poking out of the water. This is probably because Mývatn is a fairly shallow lake (average depth of 2.5 metres).</p>

<h1>
Goðafoss
</h1>
<p>Goðafoss literally translates to “waterfall of gods”. The story behind the name goes back to Þorgeir Þorkelsson Ljósvetningagoði, who was the Law Speaker of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Althing">Althing</a> (kind of like a chieftain). In the year 1000, Þorgeir had to decide whether or not Icelanders had to adopt Christainity. After he made his decision to adopt Christianity, he threw all of his statues of the pagan gods into Goðafoss, which is the source of the name.</p>

On the way to Akureyri
</h1>
<p>Akureyri is the largest city outside of Reykavik. The drive coming in from the northwest brought us around he fjord into Akureyri. We were very lucky to have a beautiful sunset on our way leading in.</p>

<p>Akureyri itself was a fairly urbanized city (not unlike Egilsstaðir). It has a population of about 17000 and a popular botanical garden (that I did not get a chance to go to).</p>
