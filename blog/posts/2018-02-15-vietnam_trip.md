I went on holiday to Vietnam and Hong Kong in January 2018.
Admittedly, the original motivations were to escape the dreary Berlin winter
and to go with my parents to discover my _roots_ (as I don't speak Vietnamese).
However, the trip has fundamentally changed some of my ideas of travelling.
Here are some of the highlights/thoughts that occurred to me during the trip:

* Saigon is my favourite city. 
The weather was awesome (in mid-January) and food was really good. 
Unfortunately I also got really sick and was not able to see as much of the city as I would've liked.
We visited many pagodas, including one that holds the ashes of my great-grandparents.

* I had a somewhat strange identity crisis in Vietnam and Hong Kong.
My full name is very Vietnamese, but I don't speak any Vietnamese
because my parents are both ethnically Chinese.
So when people read my name, they would try to speak to me in Vietnamese and fail.
Although I know a bit of Cantonese,
I also didn't really fit in in Hong Kong either.
My Cantonese probably sounded strange as I never properly learned the grammar and had a limited vocabulary
(and also not understanding "formal" Cantonese, as those spoken in the news or public announcements).
I guess it made me identify even more with being Canadian.

* I found the imagery of French tourists 
fighting for photo opportunities at the temple in the Imperial Citadel in Hue
somewhat disturbing. 
Taking into account the economic differences between the average Vietnamese to the average Frenchman,
it's hard for me not to think that perhaps colonialism hasn't completely left,
but has just taken the form of cultural commodification.

* We got scammed in Danang. 
The local bus to Hoi An, which costs 16,000 VND according to their website and sign at the front of the bus, 
charged each of us 50,000 VND (the "conductor" then pretended like he didn't understand English when we complained).
I was initially outraged at the injustice, 
but 50,000 VND ~ 1.75 EUR, which costs less than one trip in Berlin AB Zone. 
So now I consider it a contribution to Vietnam's economy.

* Admittedly, the poverty in Vietnam made me feel like an invader. 
In particular, I found that the more _off-the-beaten-path_ places that we go 
(like deep in the Mekong or up in the mountain region around Sapa)
the worse I felt about visiting.
There is something inherently unfair in the fact that someone like me
(as someone who have a relatively substantial amount of wealth
where I can travel half the world for leisure)
can stroll through villages for _cultural immersion_ 
among people who can only afford one meal per day.

* Sapa is a remote village in the mountains near the Chinese border,
which is popular for tourism to experience the daily life of the indigenous Hmong people.
There were signs all over the town warning visitors to not buy from local street vendors.
I did not see these types of signs in other parts of Vietnam
which made me think that there was perhaps a racial component to these messages. 

* Hong Kong is just one big shopping mall. 
Lots of good food, cheap electronics, luxury goods, bankers/rich people, expensive cars, and mountains.
It's like a weird blend of Vancouver and London.
It's nice to visit, but I would hate to live there.

Overall, the trip was eye-opening in that I now want to know more about my ancestral heritage
as well as the conditions that cause my family to move so often.
It has also made me fundamentally question my identity as a Chinese-Vietnamese-Canadian,
and got me to really rethink about my values with travelling and
cultural immersion in relation to my own background.
