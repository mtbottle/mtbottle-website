<p>I’ve been back in Toronto for one year now. Since I’m back in North America, I can’t say that I’ve travelled very much this year.</p>
<p>I did take a short business trip to Ottawa in February. I got to see Carleton University (for the first time) and saw the unfinished subway.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to have happened to me is that I changed jobs… again. There were a couple of reasons why I left the job, but the 2 main reasons were related to my commute (45 minutes each way) and a developing fear that I was not technically rounded enough to adapt to new technologies. So my new job is now much closer to home and is primarily using a different technology than what I’ve been programming in the past 6 years. I still have in my mind, an idea that I should try working in a consultancy at some point to get more technical breadth.</p>
<p>I got my piano back this summer. I’ve been learning a few pieces, mostly Debussy and Chopin. In particular: Reverie (Debussy), Waltz in C# Minor (Chopin) Nocturne in Eb Major (Chopin), and Waltz in Ab Major (Chopin). Maybe someday I can play the Revolutionary Etude (Chopin) and Clair de Lune (Debussy).</p>
<p>I’ve also given up on alcohol since October. The most surprising result from this was that it has saved me a lot of money (well, it should be obvious considering how expensive alcohol is here). I also haven’t really missed it very much, but that’s partly because I don’t socialize much anymore. I think I will probably go back to drinking at some point, but probably less than I use to drink when living in Europe.</p>
<p>I’ve also got myself a new smart phone this year. It’s mostly for my new job, which requires me to be oncall regularly.</p>
<p>I also managed to read up to 100 books this year. Admittedly, it became a pain as I got closer to 100 books. My goal is always only 52 books, and I always go past it with a wide margin. At some point when I reached 80 books this year, I thought that I should maybe really try to hit 100 books. However, I started only reading for the sake of hitting the goal and found myself <em>dreading</em> reading after my 100th book. Anyways, I hope to be less ambitious this year and not pressure myself to read when I don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>Lastly, the only travelling I did this year was to a resort in Cuba over Christmas. It was underwhelming; lots of sun, sand and not much else otherwise. I regret going over Christmas, as I found that I had wished that I was with my family instead. Anyways, I will probably avoid going to resorts in the future and probably also not travel over Christmas.</p>
<p>I kind of regret not focusing more on my health this year, so maybe I’ll try to exercise regularly and eating better. I also didn’t draw or paint much this year. Hopefully with the time saved on my commute, I will feel motivated to draw again.</p>
