title: Iceland: My Journey into Middle Earth (Day 1)
---

I've got my working holiday visa to the UK, so instead, I decided to go to Iceland. Well... really just for a 7 day layover (April 29 to May 5 2014) before I head to the UK.

Our plan was to drive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_%28Iceland%29">around the island</a> and somehow end up on the west fjords on the second last day, but otherwise we just booked hostels as we journeyed on. I will also be including shiny pictures for these posts as I have just gotten a shiny new LG Google Nexus 5 phone! (just needed an excuse to play with it more)

<h1>Introduction</h1>
We all know that the Lord of the Rings movies were filmed primarily in New Zealand. However, I didn't realize that Tolkien works were heavily influenced by Icelandic culture and landscape. From hobbit homes to deathly Mordor-ic mountains to idyllic villages in fjordic valleys, you definitely feel like you are in middle earth as you travel in Iceland.
<h1>Blue Lagoon Spa</h1>
We had already booked a day at the <a href="http://www.bluelagoon.com/">Blue Lagoon spa</a>, which is a man made hotspring. I was feeling kind of sick as we flew in (from both the lack of food and not sleeping enough because of our red-eye flight), so I wasn't sure how I was going to feel going to a spa. However, Blue Lagoon is supposedly known for it's healing effects and rejuvenation of skin. The water is 2/3 sea water, and 1/3 fresh water, and warmed by geothermal heat of a nearby volcano. Although I hate admitting this (because it is a tourist trap), I enjoyed my day at Blue Lagoon. It was relaxing and I re-energized from the lack of sleep due to flying in on an uncomfortable red-eye flight.
<h1>Iceland's famous food...</h1>
One of the things that came as a surprise to me was Icelander's obsession with hotdogs. You can literally find it at almost any N1 gas stations all over the countries. On the first night of our stay in Reykjav√≠k, we visited one of the more famous hot dog stands in Iceland.

The taste of the hotdog is a bit more "lamb-y" than the hotdogs I'm familiar with in North America.
