<p>This was the first morning where we didn’t have any sun in the morning. As with the previous day, we did not have a plan as we set out on our journey other than knowing that we had to reach Bíldudalur in the western fjords.</p>

<h1>
Setting out from Sæberg
</h1>
<p>Going up to the western fjords, we had to detour off of the ring road. We first turned north on the 68, then went west on the 59 until we reached route 60. Route 60 was the main highway that connects the populated part of south-west Iceland with the western fjords.</p>
<p>The day started out rainy, but we had to drive through some nice mountains.</p>

On our tourist map, there was supposed to be a point of interest around Búðardalur called Laugar. We did not manage to find it, and skipped it entirely. Laugar is supposed to contain a local museum and a hot spring.
<h1>
Ólafsdalur detour
</h1>
<p>We took a detour off from route 60 because there was a tourist POI sign labelled Ólafsdalur. We did not really know what Ólafsdalur was, but since the route 690 was on one side of the fjord and we saw lots of large electricity towers coming in, I thought it might have had something to do with electrical infrastructure (perhaps some power station into the west fjord). However, as we neared the cusp of the fjord, we found a building.</p>

<p>The building was closed (notice a theme?), but from a sign on the back door, it looks like the building is opened everyday from July to mid-August from 13:00 to 17:00. The admission price is 500 ISK and the attraction are local workshops (cultural workshops on stuff like cheese, wool or seaweed). There were also the remains of older buildings around the intact building. After doing some research, it looks like the school was active in the late 19th century to early 20th century, which means the newer building was probably built more recently for community purposes.</p>

Views from route 60 and sheep crossing
</h1>
<p>We continued our way on route 60 north. Although the weather was generally gloomy, it was more typical of the average Icelandic day than our previous sunny days.</p>

<p>We also ran into some sheep crossing a bridge. Of course we gave them the right of way…</p>
<h1>
Finding Flókatóftir and Gisli saga on route 62
</h1>
<p>One of the destinations that was sort of planned was the visit to Flókatóftir which is just off the intersection of route 62 and 60. This was slightly off on the western side of Vatnsfjörður. We passed it because our visitor’s map was crap.</p>
<p>Continuing on route 62, we came across a Gisli saga infoboard. This one was about the Icelandic woman’s support of Gisli in his time of need.</p>

Kleifabui near Patreksfjörður

<p>This was apparently a stone statue built by those who worked on the road.</p>

<h1>
Coming into Bíldudalur
</h1>
<p>We were ahead of schedule on this day and came in while it was still fairly light. The view was reminescent of the one going into Seyðisfjörður (as we were entering the fjord), but it did not extend as high.</p>

The closer we got to town, it was clear that it was a fairly wide valley.
