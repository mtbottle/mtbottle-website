<p>Wow, time goes by so quickly. In summary: it was a bad year for crypto-currencies, social media, Ukraine, Tesla, Pakistan and the climate. I do hope that there’s finally a reckoning with unsustainable (North American) car-centric lifestyle and it’s cost on the climate, mental and physical health, and maintenance/usage cost (subsidized by cheap oil and the fact that infrastructure is fairly new).</p>
<p>As for myself, I got sick a lot this year. This is what life is like with a toddler in daycare. However, I never tested positive for COVID even though I was fairly ill several times this year. And I’m still recovering from something, so starting off the new year still mildly sick.</p>
<p>I started writing more in my free time and made an effort to publish more this year. I made it more convienient to jot down notes or blog ideas by having a shared central location to access my writings across devices, which was the main reason for my success with publishing more stuff this year.</p>
<p>Early in the year, I wrote about my laptop being on the verge of explosion. I ended up giving away that 2015 MBP which was then replaced by a free one that I got from my job when I quit (2019 MBP). I also got myself a new Samsung Tablet which I still use a surprising amount.</p>
<p>It’s hard to make a decision on my favourite book this year, but if I had to narrow it down, it would be between:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30312747-not-quite-narwhal">Not Quite Narwhal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36748607-p-is-for-pterodactyl">P is for Pterodactyl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54809220-the-rock-from-the-sky">The Rock from the Sky</a> (don’t actually read this to a 2 year old though, it’s kind of scary for them)</li>
</ul>
<p>They all happen to be children’s books, none of which are at the right level for my toddler. I’m not sure what that says about me.</p>
<p>The <em>“Great Resignation”</em> was full in effect at the beginning of the year. However as we approached the end of the year, there were many layoffs. Even then, I decided to change my job during this time.</p>
<p>I had enjoyed working at my previous company. The people were great, company was renowned and the projects were mostly interesting. After a team change at the beginning of the year, I found myself slipping from being one of the team’s most senior people (more or less acting as a team lead) to being right in the middle or on the middle-junior side of the team. This meant that all the interesting large projects that I wanted to lead were slowly becoming out of reach and be given to those more <em>senior</em> than me (and I’ll probably be left with smaller projects at <em>“my level”</em>, due to a slowly creeping title inflation that left me inflated out). I decided that to fix this problem, I would have to either <em>actually</em> work on promotion (which included compiling a “promo” package where I write a 10 page document convincing a panel of random peers that I deserve to be promoted) or move elsewhere. Moving elsewhere was apparently much faster and easier. And my new company also checks off another career bucket list item, so total win-win.</p>
<p>Lastly, some of my favourite phrases coming from my toddler this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>“water is too wet”</li>
<li>“that was a BIG one”</li>
<li>“RAWR! I lion/tiger/bear”</li>
<li>“no kick mama, kick dada”</li>
<li>“you have a big butt!”</li>
<li>“I love you yellow blankey”</li>
</ul>
