title: Do I Need Mobile Data?

I've cancelled my data plan for my phone.
Admittedly, this didn't come about by a conscious decision to stop using data.
O2 made it too difficult to top up my phone and so I just gave up.
If their auto-renewal and online payment system worked, 
I probably would not be writing this article at all, 
and would be happily wasting money on a phone plan that I don't need.

If I was to ask myself what was something I couldn't live without 
(about this time last year),
I'm pretty sure that phone data would make it into the top 10.
Having internet available on my phone 
covers having internet (in general) and it is also mobile.
I use it for things like not getting lost in foreign places
and translating food ingredients so I can manage my diet 
while visiting a non-English speaking country.
I also use the mobile internet to coordinate meetings with friends 
and be available for work notifications.
So, when I failed to renew my plan because their website was not working,
I decided that I will just stop using it for a couple of days
and go back on it once I find my life unbearable...

... and so I've been off data for a over a month
and adaptation was much simpler than I thought.
I think some of my lifestyle factors that contributed to the quick adaptation are:

1. I work remotely, so don't need to commute and have constant connection to home internet.
2. I don't use transportation apps, like Uber or Car2Go (I can't even drive)
3. In addition to #2, most of my everyday transportation involves: walking, transit or cycling,
which does not require a phone at all.

It also helps that people that I would need to contact 
(in the case of meeting up with friends or colleagues) 
are available over SMS.
When I'm away from home, 
I have found that I generally don't need a map if I just look up directions ahead of time.
And if I do get lost, I can just use a cached-offline version.
As a last resort, I can of course try to find a cafe with open internet.
Living in the city, that's probably a decent survival technique.

It also helps that about 6 out of 7 days of the week are routine.
When I leave the house, it is usually to the supermarket
which is no more than a 5 minutes walk.
I don't usually leave my neighbourhood for lunch 
because of the plethora of local options. 
I no longer take German classes, but if I did,
I would probably enroll in one of the many around my neighbourhood.
And I don't particularly like going to tech meetups or events anymore
(probably can be the subject of another blog article).
So all in all, most days I'm within 15 minutes walk of home internet.

The hardest adaptation is not being able to use the BVG app
(*Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe Gesellschaft*, the transit authority in Berlin)
to pay for transit.
However, this just involves keeping a stash of paper tickets in my wallet
(I keep at least one usually anyways for when my phone is out of batteries).
But because I work from home, taking the train is an unusual occurrence.

So if there is a moral to this, 
it is perhaps that the vices of laziness and inefficient systems 
*can* lead to cost savings.
