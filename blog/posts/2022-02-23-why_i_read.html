<p>I try to read 52 books a year.
There are people who read more,
but many more who read less.
A lot of it is fiction,
but I also read a lot of non-fiction books too.
People who are impressed by how much I read usually ask,
<em>“How do you remember everything that you read?”</em>.
My answer to that is usually: <em>I don’t</em>.</p>
<p>If I don’t retain everything that I read,
then why do I still try to read so many books?
Wouldn’t it be better if I read less, but retained more?</p>
<p>I think that reading a lot of books helps me build <em>intuition</em>.
I may not remember exactly what lead me to think a certain way,
but the accumulated knowledge of the thoroughly edited books that I’ve read
leads me to having a better judgement on things.</p>
<p>The classic example is fiction.
There are studies that show that people who read a lot of fiction
tends to be
<a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-reading-fiction-increases-empathy-and-encourages-understanding">more empathetic</a>.
Do we remember necessarily which character fits which real life person/situation?
Probably not.
But the accumulation of the experiences of characters that you read
will give you a better understanding of the vast range of human thought.</p>
<p>So, although I don’t retain most of what I read
(and I’m also terrible with quoting books),
I read because I enjoy reading
and also because I’m building my intuition on whatever topic interests me.</p>
