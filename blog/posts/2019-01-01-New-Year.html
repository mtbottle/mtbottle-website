<p>This was both an exciting year, and also luckily not too eventful (ie, no more health incident).</p>
<p>I started off the year with a trip to Vietnam and Hong Kong. We went with family, and the experience made me reconsider staying in Berlin.</p>
<p>I went to Malaga for a work trip in April. It was quite nice, but also too early in the year to enjoy lying on the beach.</p>
<p>In June, we travelled to Ireland and did a road trip around the whole island. It was very beautiful and I did quite a few paintings. I found the relaxed nature of the trip much more conducive for painting.</p>
<p>We went to Poland in July to visit family. On our way back, we also passed by Malbork, Toruń, and Bydgoszcz.</p>
<p>I went to Europython in Edinburgh in July. I enjoyed it more than other conferences because I was meeting up with collegues. I also went to Pycon Canada in November. It was also alright because I was not creeped out (unlike the meetups/conferences I’ve been to in Berlin). I think Berlin was a particular bad case, as I never had problems in Seattle or London either.</p>
<p>I went to Venice and Florence in August. It was a very nice trip; both were touristy cities, but the weather was exceptional. I went with my brother, so it was a nice sibling bonding time. It was also the first trip I’ve been where I didn’t plan things out in details, and so we ended up sitting at cafes sipping coffee or wine for hours. I think I really enjoy this form of travel, and maybe can do more of this in the future.</p>
<p>I also made the decision to resign at the company I was working at in August. It was difficult, but I think it was the correct decision. I definitely had a major sense of relief after I resigned.</p>
<p>Soon after I resigned, I also got offered a new job in Toronto.</p>
<p>I moved back to Toronto at the end of October. So we had the rest of the summer in Berlin. It was a beautiful dry summer, and we spent it eating icecream in the park. It’s still too early to tell if I regret the decision. I think Berlin will always have a place in my heart, but seeing family and friends every few weeks is a definite plus.</p>
<p>Before returning to Toronto, we spent a week on the Azores. It was a relaxing holiday; we ate a lot of steak and dipped in many hotsprings.</p>
<p>I suspect that we will travel less now that we’re back in Canada. I’ve got half the amount of vacation days as my previous company. Also, adjusting to a non-remote work environment wasn’t too difficult. However, I definitely miss the freedom of working from home.</p>
<p>In terms of goals for this year, I think I want to do more with art and also more for my career.</p>
