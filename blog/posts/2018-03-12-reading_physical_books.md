title: On Reading Physical Books 
tags: reflection

I've recently bought myself a physical copy of _The Order of Things_
by Michel Foucault.
I don't usually keep physical copies of books because I move often 
and it is not very economical to continually ship them with me when I move. 
However, I have been avoiding purchasing things off Amazon recently 
and luckily found a physical copy of this book in a local bookshop.
So I purchased it.

There is a sort of romance to holding a physical book that you don't get with an e-reader.
There is the tactile nature of the book itself,
the physical movement of turning a page and flipping through the sections.
Sometimes I like to skip to the spoilers at the end, or flip back to find the moment of foreshadow.
Then there's also the imagery of the person sitting by the window in a coffee shop,
with their fingers grazing the page while their eyes look out to reflect on the passage that they've just read.
One can try to imagine these scenarios with an e-reader,
but the artistry of the scene pales in comparison.

So being the first physical book I've picked up in over a year,
I found myself dissatisfied with the experience.
For instance, the binding of the book made it uncomfortable to read the book in bed,
where my lamp shines at an angle from the side
so that the words near the margin will inevitably end up in shadow. 
Also, I like to read while lying down, and although my book is not _very_ heavy,
my forearms will eventually feel the strain of holding the weight of the book and hands in the same overhead position. 
Any attempt to turn myself to lay the book on its side 
will mean that part of the book will be in unwanted shadows. 

Then there's also the constant distraction in the back of my mind about whether or not
the book is _good_ enough that I will want to keep it on my next move:
_Will this book be a good reference in the future? How many books should I ship back?_
Or even: _Should I just get an e-book copy of this after I'm done?_

And lastly, there's also the guilt that I'm just accumulating _junk_. 
After I purchase an e-book, it has no _presence_,
but with a physical book, it literally _weighs_ me down.
An e-book is an _experience_, but a physical book is just more _stuff_. 

Admittedly, I still enjoy being able to flip back easily to scan through old passages, 
especially since _The Order of Things_ is a particularly dense read.
However, I'm finding that I've gone _technological_ and there's no coming back.
