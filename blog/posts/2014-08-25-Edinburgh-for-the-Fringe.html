            <h1>Edinburgh for the Fringe</h1>

            <div class="info">
<em>Posted on August 25, 2014</em>
    
</div>

<p>For the last several Augusts in my life, I have visited fringe festivals in various cities (well… just Toronto and Vancouver). I have always enjoyed indie theatre. If I was to psychoanalyze, I would say that I’m living vicariously through my latent remorse for not going to art school for film (but who’s asking). Also, since I was getting antsy from the lack of adventuring that I was doing while I am in London, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to visit the origin of the Fringe. So this is an entry on my adventures in Edinburgh (August 17 to 19th, 2014) and some reviews of Fringe theatre that I watched.</p>

<h1>
Before going
</h1>
<p>Admittedly, I had procrastinated on booking Fringe accommodations and was not able to find a <a href="https://www.hihostels.com">HI hostel</a> room for a full weekend, so I had to settle for half a weekend and several days off work. We booked a private room (all the dorms were taken) in the beginning of June. Also before going, we looked up several theatre that we wanted to watched and pre-purchased the tickets (just to make sure we had some plays to watch in case everything was sold out on the spot… but upon arriving we realized that we have nothing to fear).</p>
For transport, we took the East Coast train north on Sunday, and returned on the Virgin train on the west coast tracks on the way back. The west coast train was slightly longer and also less scenic than the East Coast train.
<h1>
Impressions of Edinburgh
</h1>
<p>Edinburgh is a historical city that is built on a hill. At the centre of the city is the <a href="http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk">castle</a>. The neat thing about Edinburgh is that it is a city that is built in layers. There are winding stairs that take you up or down to different parts of the city. There are also bridges that passes over lower streets in the city (ie. Cowgate), which makes it feel like an old historical maze.</p>
<p>The immediate surrounding area around the Edinburgh-Waverly train station were historical buildings which made it feel much more nostalgic or historical. Further up the street around our hostel, the roads were much bigger and jaywalking was much more difficult because there was more traffic. The width of Leith Street reminds me of North American roads, but there were so many barriers (supposedly to protect pedestrians? or control pedestrian flow?) that it was kind of annoying to walk around, especially since I was just getting used to jaywalking around London.</p>

<p>Since we were there for the Fringe festival, the city was overwrought by tourists (which was unfortunate as I was looking forward to being immersed in people speaking English Scottishly).</p>
<p>We also walked up to Arthur’s Seat and to the highest point of the crags. The view was amazing for such a short walk from the city.</p>

<p>It is amazing how walkable Edinburgh was. We did not take public transport to any of our Fringe theatre, nor to the crags.</p>
I had also went to Edinburgh castle. The entrance was £16 to see a bunch of military museums and the royal jewels. However, even on a Tuesday afternoon, it was teeming with tourists. Most of the buildings were not opened for public viewing which led to some disappointment with the attraction in general. The view from the castle wall was still quite nice though.

The Theatre
</h1>
I will review the plays that I saw in the order that I saw them.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/silence-in-court">Silence in Court</a>
</h2>
<p>This was a mock court simulation where the audience gets to interact as jury to the court case being presented. The court case being presented was about a rape accusation where there were no witnesses and no evidence to the alleged rape. Without spoiling the play, it was an interactive piece where the audience gets to decide whether the defendant was guilty or innocent. It was interactive and we got to see the thinking process of how normal people deliberate on decisions that [fictionally] affect lives. Since I’ve never been in a real courtroom, I cannot say whether the actors were believable. It was great to see that both barristers and the judge had some personality (and quibbles).</p>
However, due to the time constraints and limited resources for the mock play, the trial only consisted of testimonies from the defendant and the accuser. There was no physical evidence nor witnessed. These constraints removed some believability of the court case for me.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/box-free">The Box</a>
</h2>
The box was a dark piece of drama about people getting cursed by a “box”. The drama hints at something sentient in the box that destroys the lives of people who steals it and compels those who wouldn’t otherwise to steal it. Upon entering the theatre room, you are greeted with two of the actors drenched in eerie lighting which already gives the piece a sombre feel. Then you see how people’s lives have fallen apart, and get a sense of their desperation and the dark mystery of the box. I felt that the piece was very human; what happens when you encounter the supernatural? First there’s scepticism, then denial and finally acceptance. The acting was superb and I really enjoyed the play.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/art-of-falling-apart">The Art of Falling Apart</a>
</h2>
This was a comedic piece of theatre about Callum, who is your average 35 year old man, going through an existential crisis. He has a job he’s just “meh” about, and a longterm, cohabiting girlfriend that he squabbles with over inane things. There are overtones in the play (and presumably in Callum’s life) that he needs to be better than he currently is, which leads him to the existential crisis. What is he doing with his life? Is there something more than his life than just <em>this?</em> It was a play that anyone who has fallen in an existential crisis can appreciate. The Art of Falling Apart explores Callum’s existential crisis with humour and absurdity (there’s a whole mock “inspirational” talk about being the best at failure). It was both moving and funny at the same time. I also highly recommend this play.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/conflict-in-court">Conflict in Court</a>
</h2>
This is a sequel to Silence in Court. It takes the same format, but the case was different. The case presented is on a libel case regarding a Tory MP and the editor of the magazine that published a scandal regarding the MP. Unlike Silence in Court, this case introduces a surprise witness, which adds an additional dimensionality to the court case. I preferred the topic of this court case more than the first one (this topic seems less sensitive than a rape accusation, and hence I did not have as much issue with making a firm opinion). As with Silence in Court, I enjoyed the interactivity of the court case and hearing random audience’s opinions and thought processes.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/according-to-his-need">According to his need</a>
</h2>
I found a posting for this play after dinner on Monday and figured it was a great way to fill up our time until the next late night play we had already bought tickets for. According to his Need was a comedic play about a guy who joins a communist activism group to find a girlfriend. He meets a girl and they hit it off in the typical rom-com way. However, their relationship is hinged on their conflicting premises: he’s in the communist group so that he can find a girlfriend, and she’s only with him to seduce him into the communist ideology. Of course, the relationship becomes more complicated than that as you see them grow mutual affection for each other. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of the two actors and they were very likeable. I was also amused by all the communist jargon and academic lingo I was able to understand from the flirty scenes. This was definitely a nice break from all the dark theatre I am prone to watch. One interesting thing to note is that the screenwriter is only 17 (<a href="http://www.broadwaybaby.com/show.php?id=700809">source</a>). It makes me feel slightly unaccomplished in life…
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/temptation-of-st-anthony">The Temptation of St. Anthony</a>
</h2>
This play is based loosely on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptation_of_Saint_Anthony_%28Flaubert%29">work of Flaubert</a>. We start off the play with “demons” looking for Anthony in the desert where he is mediating on the existence of God. Throughout the play, the demons all come to him to try to get him to commit sin. We see the internal conflicts of Anthony as he deals with his beliefs in God. This piece was particularly artsy, and hard to follow (especially since I was not familiar with the source material). It was definitely disquieting, with a piano playing mime in the background and a vision of Anthony’s mother and lover who attempts to convince him to kill himself. I did not understand the ending of the play, but not sure if it was meant to be understood.
<h2>
<a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/architects-and-anarchists">Architects and Anarchists</a>
</h2>
Architects and Anarchists was the last play that I had went to see. It is a play about a writer with unrequited love who have metaphysical entities in his mind that he can communicate with called Virtue and Satan. They encompass the good and evil parts of the stories he writes. All the stories that the writer create reflect his unrequited love. It was a touching play with absurd humour and some powerful moments (ie. Virtue’s powerful monologue at the end). Some of the acting was subpar, but it was still a worthwhile piece of drama.

Scotland again?
</h1>
<p>Due to the busy Fringe schedule, I did not have a chance to explore Edinburgh quite as thoroughly as I would have liked. I will probably visit Edinburgh and Scotland again during off season to be able to fully explore the history and surrounding areas.</p>
