There have been several major life events for me this year.

The obvious big event that affected everyone is the pandemic.
Jobs that were not remote friendly needed to shift to being
more accepting of totally remote work.
My job was not *really* remote
but most of my colleagues were already coming into the office once a week.
So, this was just the catalyst for it to be completely remote.

I found out that I was pregnant early in the year,
and gave birth to a healthy baby at the end of summer.
This meant that the pandemic happened throughout most of my pregnancy.
There was some anxiety about possibly getting sick during the pregnancy,
but lockdowns and working from home meant less chance of exposure.

We also bought a house at the start of lockdown.
I think we were quite lucky because the market is still pretty crazy in Toronto.

I've learned that the hardest part of being a new parent
is figuring out who to listen to for advice and what to ignore.
Doctors are generally reliable for medical advice,
but they don't necessarily know how to schedule your baby's naps
or how to help you with breast feeding.
There are consultants for these, which I had been fortunate enough
to afford or get through work.
It does make me sympathize with poor families who may not have access to these resources.

My baby is cuter than I had expected and the love is overwhelming.

I managed to reach my reading goal this year.
However, my reading has slowed down since I became a parent,
so let's see how it goes next year.

I really miss travelling.

I will be back to work in a few months,
which I'm looking forward to.
And hopefully with the vaccine discovered,
next year will go back to something sort of resembling
the life before the pandemic.
