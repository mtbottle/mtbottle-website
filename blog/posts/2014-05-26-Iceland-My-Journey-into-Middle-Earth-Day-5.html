<p>The 5th day of the trip started out beautifully (like the last 5 days of our trip). We started the day without a plan, but decided that we’ll stop at the “interest points” along the way.</p>

<h1>
Gásir: Medieval port of trade
</h1>
<p>Just 11 km north of Akureyri is the ruins of a medieval trading port called Gásir. The trading post was active from the 13th to 15th century where Iceland’s main export was sulphur. In the 14th century, Iceland’s main trading partner at this post was with Bergen, Norway. However in the 15th century, most of the trade done at this post was with the English.</p>

<p>The camp itself was only a seasonal camp where there was no evidence that anyone lived there all year round. However to my untrained archeological eyes, I could not tell what this was.</p>

Moutain pass from Akureyri to Varmahlíð
</h1>
<p>The morning was beautiful, and I had just loaded my phone with <i>My Head is an Animal</i> album by Of Monsters and Men the previous evening (it was sacrilege that I didn’t load this and the Lord of the Rings soundtrack before the trip!).</p>
<h1>
Örlygsstaðir memorial
</h1>
<p>Just at the exit of the mountain pass was the Örlygsstaðir memorial. Örlygsstaðir was the site of the largest battle ever fought on Icelandic lands. It was a time of civil strife between family clans on the island as Norwegian king (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_IV_of_Norway">Hákon The Old</a>) was extending his naval influence over the island. The battle took place on August 21, 1238 and was primarily between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturla_Sighvatsson">Sturla Sighvatsson</a> of the Sturlungar family clan and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolbeinn_the_Young">Kolbeinn ungi Arnórsson</a> (also known as Kolbeinn the Young) of the Ásbirningar family clan. Sturla wanted to unite the chiefdoms on the island under the rule of king Hákon through military might. However, this only antagonized the other chiefdoms on the island. Örlygsstaðir was Sturla’s last stand against the Ásbirningar and Haukdælir clan alliance (Haukdælir was led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gissur_%C3%9Eorvaldsson">Gissur Þorvaldsson</a>. In the end, the Sturlungar was no match to the alliance of Haukdælir and Ásbirningar. This was the bloodiest battle in Iceland’s history (49 death from the losing side and 7 deaths from the winning side).</p>

<h1>
Glaumbær and the church
</h1>
<p>We drove up to <a href="http://www.glaumbaer.is/is/information/glaumbaer-farm">Glaumbær</a>, which is supposedly an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_turf_house">Icelandic turf house</a> museum. The original settlement of the land dates back to 900 CE, but continued to add additions to the house up to the 19th century. The museum itself was closed for the season, but we were able to walk around outside the turf house.</p>

<p>The roof of the house is made of grass (similar to hobbit houses). The walls were stacked layers of turf.</p>

<p>The church next to Glaumbær was opened (who locks their doors in Iceland anyways). So we decided to walk into it.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TKEFPPQ5AKI/U2VsEXTEARI/AAAAAAAAD2M/sK_3YZ1VlmI/w500-h667-no/IMG_20140503_140813.jpg" alt>

Church next door.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At first I couldn’t tell if the church was part of Glaumbær, or was an actual community church. In the end, I think the church was in active use (because there were stacks of bibles at the back). The church itself is quite small, probably only serving the small immediate community.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
We spent a while looking through the gravestones at the back of the house. If the gravestones were a good judge of how old the church was, it seems that it must have been built in the late 19th century (which makes it much newer than Glaumbær).
<h1>
Icelandic horses
</h1>
<p>There were lots of cute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_horse">Icelandic horses</a> all over Iceland. They are smaller and furrier than their continental kinds (and standardly considered “ponies” by world horse sizing standards). There are lots of laws regarding importing other horses or tools that have been used on other horse breeds to protect the Icelandic breed from diseases.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
Although there are stringent methods for making sure that the horses are protected, you can still see them all along the island when you drive around. The region that we were passing through from Glaumbær to Sæberg was particularly plentiful in horses and sheep. They were often close enough to the road that we could stop the car and go up to pet them.
<h1>
Borgarvirki the military fort
</h1>
<p>We decided to take a detour off the ring road (onto route 716 then 717) to go to Borgarvirki, on the eastern side of the Vatnsnes penninsula. Borgarvirki was built on a natural volcanic formation called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_plug">volcanic plug</a>. This particular volcanic plug was made of columnar basalt. The volcanic plug made the top of the rock formation an ideal location for a military fort. It is believed that the fortress was in use in 870-1030 CE.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
The volcanic plug formation made the rock an ideal place for a fort. It already looks like the walls of a fortress!
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the Heiðarvíga saga, it was said that viking Viga-Barði built the fortress around 1000 CE when he was besieged by Borgarfjörður’s men. The men of Borgarfjörður wanted to seige Barði by starving them out of Borgarvirki, however he threw out their last blood sausage to trick the enemy into thinking that they had more food than they actual had. This tricked Borgarfjörður’s men enough that they gave up on the siege.</p>
<h1>
Driving around Vatnsnes and seals
</h1>
<p>Since we were already halfway up the Vatsnes peninsula and were not pressed for time, we decided to drive all around it.</p>
<p>The first point of interest was the site of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B3sa_Gu%C3%B0mundsd%C3%B3ttir">Rósa Guðmundsdóttir’s</a> farm. She was a well known 19th century Icelandic poet who was a mistress around the Vatnsendi region. Icelander also know her as Skáld-Rósa, which stands for “lyrical Rósa”.</p>
<figure>

<p>Her grave is also on the north side of Vesturhópsvatn.</p>
<p>The next stop was an interesting rock formation called Hvítserkur.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is a 15 metres tall basalt formation amidst volcanic residue. I don’t think there is any legend behind it, but it is an interesting piece to look at.</p>
<p>We also came upon a monument for another poet, Gudmundur Bergþórsson.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Monument and Jarek off doing what he always doing… checking the map on his phone
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Gudmund was a poet who was active in the late 17th century (1657-1705). He was mainly known for his Icelandic ballads. I do not know the significance of the monument (it seems a bit modern for a poet from the 17th century).</p>
<p>There were seal viewing signs all over the north western side of Vatnsnes. We wanted to see seals really badly, so we parked around one of these signs and waited about 20 minutes for them to show up.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We were really lucky to see any seals because this was fairly early in seal season.</p>
<p>Continuing down the western side of Vatnsnes, we stumbled upon Hamarsrétt, which looks like a circus animal pen.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sRa5X8OCZKM/U2Vt0x0HpfI/AAAAAAAAEDQ/hx4qAc3XdCM/w889-h667-no/IMG_20140503_183808.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>
Hamarsrétt, we didn’t know what it does at the time.
</figcaption>
</figure>
After some searching on the internet, it looks like Hamarsrétt is a traditional sheep sorting tool. Basically all the sheep will be herded into the centre of the pen, then farmers will check the tags of the sheep and place them into the correct “spoke” of the pen.

Driving to Sæberg
</h1>
<p>We exited out of Vatnsnes peninsula and continued our way to Sæberg on the ring road. The sun slowly disappeared behind the clouds as we reached Sæberg.</p>
