<p>Since we were going to hostel around the country, we needed to stock up on non-perishable foods. Also, because I am on the ketogenic diet we couldn’t just subsist on apples and bread (although that would have made life easier). So for carrying meat and dairy in a car all day, we decided to find a small cooler bag. Unfortunately, late April is not “summer” and it was impossible to find cooler bags. <a href="http://www.hagkaup.is/">Hagkaup</a> (think Icelandic “Walmart”) stocks cooler bags in around mid-May, so if you set to travel around that time, you will have more chance in getting yourself a cooler bag. Instead, we hobo-ed it out with a large plastic tupperware (around 1200 kroners, or $12 CAD) and 2 ice packs. It worked surprisingly well throughout our trip.</p>

<h1>
The Golden Circle
</h1>
<p>The Golden Circle is one of Iceland’s most iconic tourist attractions. It is a series of attractions about an hour outside of Reykjavík. The significance of these attractions is that it lies on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_valley">rift valley</a> which is where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.</p>
<p>The first attraction coming in from the west was Þingvellir national park. This park had a lot of historical significance as it use to be where the parliament took place (before it was moved to Reykjavík). There are still yearly visits by the members of parliaments as commemoration of Icelandic national pride.</p>

<p>Along the main part of the parliament area, there were ruins of booths and buildings that use to be there. There was also a “Law Rock” where parliament occurred.</p>

<figcaption>
Stupidly didn’t take pictures of booths and the actual law rock. This is a picture of an info board on how it would have looked if a parliament was being held.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next stop going west was Haukadalur which is a site of geothermal geysers. There were more tourists here than in Þingvellir (at least there’s excitement here, and people with no Icelandic patriotism can appreciate steaming geysers erupting). There was also a gift shop here (for those who want cheaper Icelandic wool than <a href="http://www.alafoss.is/">Álafoss</a>).</p>

<figcaption>
Bad picture of Strokkur erupting. You can sort of see the scale with the tourists to the right.

</figure>
<p>The only geyser that was active is called Strokker. The more iconic geyser (just uncreatively called Geysir) did not erupt in the time we spent at Haukadalur. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haukadalur">Wikipedia</a>, it only erupts 4 to 5 times a day.</p>

<p>The last part of the main Golden Circle attractions is Gullfoss. Gullfoss (translates to “Golden Falls”) is a 2 layer waterfall that goes down 31 metres.</p>

<figcaption>
You can see the two layers of waterfall here (along with some crusting of ice where the second waterfall sprays).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We were there in the late afternoon, so the sun was low. I think the low sun made for a beautiful composition to the waterfall.</p>

The second waterfall looks like it is falling into the abyss…

<h1>
Seljalandsfoss
</h1>
<p>After we finished the Golden Circle, and along the way to Vik hostel, we stopped by the beatiful Seljalandsfoss.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w8gCMiK_Xgw/U2Lda8BDlJI/AAAAAAAABVo/FnY0p7J2klM/w500-h667-no/IMG_20140430_193736.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>
I was very happy to capture a rainbow in the front of Seljalandsfoss!
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The waterfall doesn’t look very distinctive from the front, but behind the waterfall was a trail that shows a beautiful green patch.</p>

<p>There were also other smaller waterfalls around the main Seljalandsfoss.</p>

The grass is green where the water runs…

<figcaption>
I tripped and fell into the muddy stream trying to reach the small shallow cave.

<h1>
Skógafoss
</h1>
<p>After we left Seljalandsfoss, we arrived at Skógafoss quite late (8pm). It was still light, so we were able to climb the stairs to the top of the waterfall.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8QsqUFngPhk/U2LgsLJZtdI/AAAAAAAABcc/IVRN02-C01s/w500-h667-no/IMG_20140430_204209.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>
The picture is a bit dark because we were in the shadows.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Legend has it that a viking called Þrasi Þórólfsson hid a treasure chest behind the waterfalls, and that you can see Þrasi’s treasures in the sprays of the waterfalls when the sun is shining. Unfortunately we arrived too late to see his treasures. However we did get a good view from up on top…</p>

We can see our rented Hyundai i20 (diesel) from here!
