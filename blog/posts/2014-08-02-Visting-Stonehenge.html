<p>As I become a Londoner, I am kind of sad to admit that I visited the Stonehenge. None of my coworkers have visited, so using them as my representative London sample, this just <em>isn’t</em> something that British people do. Regardless, here is my post on visiting the Stonehenge on July 5th, 2014.</p>

<h1>
 Going to Salisbury
</h1>
We took the Waterloo train to Salisbury, as was directed by the <a href="http://www.thestonehengetour.info">tour we decided to follow</a>. At Salisbury, we were greeted by a double decker bus that took us from the Salisbury train station to the Stone Henge. The bus included timed commentary on the history of Salisbury as we passed by certain monuments or iconic attractions around town. I found this quite informative. For example, it pointed out a strange monument called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_Cross_%28Salisbury%29">“Poultry Cross”</a> which was a medieval structure to distinguish and protect particular markets from the elements.  After a brief sightseeing excursion of the city, the bus rode us through the British countryside to the Stonehenge.
<h1>
Visiting the Stonehenge and surroundings
</h1>
<p>The online registration process was interesting. We had to book our tickets<a href="https://www.myonlinebooking.co.uk/englishheritage/sessions.aspx?tid=2"> according to our arrival time</a>. So we booked it for 13:00. But when we got there, there didn’t seem to be much enforcement of when we visited.</p>
<p>One thing of note is that the Stonehenge visitor centre has moved further down the road from the actual Stonehenge. In fact the actual Stonehenge was a half hour walk from the main visitor centre. The reason is probably to deter people from trampling on the monument after hours. Luckily for those of use who have accessibility problems, there are shuttle buses that run from the visitor centre to the monument. However, the stroll along the road was a nice way to take in the British countryside.</p>
<p>The visit also entitled us to an audio tour radio device. However, the devices were somewhat shoddy and the battery died on 2 of them early on (we managed to return one and get a replacement). I managed to download the app which downloaded the components of the audio tour onto my phone which I was able to use.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Stonehenge themselves, the monument themselves were quite impressive. We were barricaded from walking close to the actual Stonehenge themselves (for preservation of the artefacts). Historically, the Stonehenge have been used for burials and other rituals, so there are many artefacts in the grounds around and away from the henges themselves. The English Heritage Society do sometimes let people walk through the monuments; for example Druids are allowed to do their solstice religious festivals on the grounds. However for the common tourists, we have to settle for seeing the monuments from afar.</p>

<p>The Stonehenge is formed by two concentric rows of boulders and ditches. Some of the stones were formed from bluestone, which was probably shipped to this location from Wales. Archaeologists states that the Stonehenge that we see was built in 3 stages with the earliest stage built around 3000 BCE, which means that it predated the Romans. Due to this fact, the common theory to who erected the Stonehenge states that it must have been those who lived here before the Romans, which were the pagans/druids. However, this theory has not been proven and no one really knows as to what the purpose of the Stonehenge really is.</p>
<p>The countryside around the Stonehenge also contains historical significance. There are burial mounds both in the Stonehenge monument and all around the countryside around. Burial mounds look essentially like a bad pimple that pokes out of the otherwise flat countryside landscape. Uneducated to their true significance, you can totally mistake them for natural formations of the land. However, mounds contain possessions of the deceased, which sometimes led to theft.</p>

Also outside the immediate vicinity of the Stonehenge laid the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge_Cursus">Stonehenge Cursus</a>. Like the Stonehenge, no one really knew what the purpose of the cursus was. The Stonehenge Cursus is a  3km strip of ditches that is purported to be older than the Stonehenge monument. While I walked on it, it was difficult to see the ditch at parts (partly due to all the cows that were trampling all over the monument).
<h1>
Old Sarum Castle
</h1>
<p>After our detour excursion around the countryside around the Stonehenge, we hopped back on a random tour bus to head to the next stop which was <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/old-sarum">Old Sarum</a>. Old Sarum is the ruins of an old medieval castle in use to about 1200 CE. You can see old toilet ditch technologies (ie. ditch in the ground where some poor peasant’s job was to dig it back up to dispose of outside the castle). The castle fell out of use in the rein of King Henry VIII and was slowly demolished and sold for materials. The current museum contains some of the remnants of the castle, including the moat and some walls.</p>

<p>The castle felt much smaller than expected. I had been envisioning a castle with a the courtyard of a small town (because that’s how many people I imagine living in a castle), but the castle felt more like the size of a big house. Of course, without the walls and decor of an actual building, it is really difficult to say what should be the “right size for a castle”.</p>
<p>Built just slightly outside of the moat was the ruins of the original cathedral. It is reported that 5 days after the completion of the cathedral, the roof collapsed in a storm. They rebuilt it and had it standing for about another 100 years in which the residents of Old Sarum moved closer to the River Avon to expand (as it was becoming difficult to expand on the hilltop of Old Sarum). The new town was then called New Sarum, and eventually Salisbury (the town we arrived from!).</p>

<h1>
Salisbury and Cathedral
</h1>
<p>After Old Sarum, we hopped back on the tour bus on our way back to Salisbury. The decided to get off at the city centre stop to explore the city. Since we heard that one of the copies of the Magna Carta was in the Salisbury Cathedral, we decided to stop by.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, we arrived in Salisbury around 5pm, which was about the same time that everything closes. The courtyard, however, was opened to the public and see the tombstone floors that lined the courtyard of the cathedral. Before coming here, I did not realize that it was a practice for families of the bishop gets to be buried inside the cathedral themselves. It was interesting and somewhat morbid to read through the tombstones along the floor of the cathedral. Otherwise, the cathedral was aesthetically grand and quite a beautiful building.</p>

<p>We had also wanted to visit the <a href="http://www.salisburymuseum.org.uk">Salisbury and South Wiltshire museum</a> as it had good reviews on the internet, but unfortunately it was closed.</p>
<p>After the cathedral and seeing that places we wanted to visit were closed, we walked along the River Avon to the train station to go home, back to our modern flat in the bustling metropolis. And it seemed almost a lifetime away.</p>
