<p>We started from Vík on our third day in Iceland. It is known to be the rainiest and wettest part of Iceland, but we were lucky that it wasn’t raining the morning we were there.</p>

Vík í Mýrdal and the Black Sand Beach
</h1>
<p>Just a 15 drive away from the town and hostel is the famous Black Sand Beach. There are a set of “sea caves” (called Halsanefshellir) along the beach that contains interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt">basalt formations</a>.</p>

<p>From the beach you can also see Dyrhólaey which is an arch-like formation in the water, and Reynisdrangar which are a set of basalt columns in the water.</p>

<p>The legend of Reynisdrangar is that the rock formations were made of two trolls who attempted to drag a ship to land but got turned to stone when they were still dragging it in the morning. Apparently trolls turned to stone in daylight!</p>

<h1>
Empty fields and tornado
</h1>
<p>Driving in the east of Vík was mostly uneventful. The landscape composed of either glacial outpouring (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6kulhlaup">Jökulhlaup</a>) which is a stretch of watery black sand, or lumpy post-volcanic fields.</p>

<p>The highlight of the drive was that the empty fields were really windy. We even managed to see a small tornado!</p>

<h1>
Kirkjubæjarklaustur: Systrafoss and the “Chuch Floor”
</h1>
<p>We made a brief stop at Kirkjubæjarklaustur on our way to Skaftafell. Our first stop was the waterfall called Systrafoss (notice a trend here? There are millions of waterfalls in Iceland).</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8AKRQsduc18/U2LmTpzVawI/AAAAAAAABpQ/G4kFJrfqYfI/w500-h667-no/IMG_20140501_124650.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>
Systrafoss is different from the previous waterfalls because of the presence of trees.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Historically, Iceland has been scarce of trees because of settlers cutting them down to use to build houses. There was an effort made in the Kirkjubæjarklaustur community to plant the trees that grows at the base of Systrafoss.</p>
<p>There was also a trail that led up to the top of Systrafoss where you can see the lake that fed into the waterfall. The lake is called Systravatn (-vatn being the Icelandic word for lake, and -foss is the Icelandic word for falls, if you haven’t gotten that already). The legend was that nuns bathed in the lake. But one day a hand holding a beautiful gold comb lured two of these nuns into the water where they disappeared forever.</p>
<figure>

<p>Also along the trail around Systrafoss, we stumbled upon Sönghellir, the singing cave. The legend was that the cave where the nuns from Kirkjubæjarklaustur would sing to the monks from þykkvabæjarklaustur. It is known for it’s echo but I didn’t try it out.</p>
<p>There is also a mound a little bit away from of Systrafoss.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Hildishagur: Hildur’s grave mound.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The mound is supposedly the grave of Hilder Eysteinsson, the heathen. The legend was that the land is only livable by Christians (as the first settlers of Kirkjubær were Irish Christians). So when Hilder set foot in his estate there, he dropped dead and was buried in the mound.</p>
<p>The final attraction in Kirkjubæjarklaustur was the Kirkjugólf, or the “church floor”. It is a flat columnar basalt formation where the rocks made a pattern that looks like the pattern on a church floor. Most of the “tiles” are hexagonal, but there are variations on the number of edges.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
This really looks like tiles on a “church floor”. Before I read the infoboard, I really thought that this was the ruins of an actual church…

<h1>
Skaftafell and touching the glacier
</h1>
<p>Skaftafell is part of the national park that it to the south of the Vatnajökull glacier (which encompasses the larger Vatnajökull national park). When we arrived at the entrance to the trail, we were greeted by many hardcore overnight backpackers. The info centre also contained a shower area for those who have just gotten back from long excursions. Since we had to get to Seyðisfjörður by the end of the day, we didn’t have the time to spend actually backpacking on the glacier. This was also the site of other popular Icelandic excursions (ie. the <a href="http://www.adventures.is/Iceland/GlacierHiking/GlacierTripsFromReykjavik">glacier walk</a> attractions you can find at any Reykavik hostels).</p>

<p>We decided to walk the simple trail that led up to the glacier and was satisfied just to touch it.</p>

I did end up walking up to onto the glacier briefly (there were signs warning not to walk onto the glacier without an experienced guide), which I count as a great travelling milestone.
<h1>
Jökulsárlón the glacial lake
</h1>
<p>A little bit west of Skaftafell is Jökulsárlón. Jökulsárlón is still technically part of Vatnajökull National Park.</p>
<figure>
<img class src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Cp9wTEZVFds/U2LxKOSYbnI/AAAAAAAACBo/wAmdxx_XJms/w889-h667-no/IMG_20140501_172835.jpg" alt>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
The lagoon was formed recently (geologically recent) due to the melting of the Vatnajökull glacier. Glacier covered Jökulsárlón up to 1900 and during 1920-1965, there was a great warming period that caused the glacier to melt really quickly, forming Jökulsárlón lagoon.
<h1>
Brief encounter with Höfn and evening drive around the eastern fjords
</h1>
<p>After a full day of very exciting adventures, we needed to restock (around 7pm in the evening… poor planning on our part). Since Höfn was the largest town along the way to Seyðisfjörður, we decided to stop by and see if there was a Bonus or any other groceries store were opened. We did find a Nettó, but it was closed. So moral of the story: don’t do your groceries after 7pm (or just late in general in Iceland).</p>
<p>After we passed Höfn, we enter the realm of the eastern fjords.</p>

Tunnel into the east!
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you take a look at the map of eastern Iceland, you will notice that the fjords on the eastern side of the island are particularly long and deep. The topology also shows that the mountains on this side were also really high.</p>

<p>The sun was low, bit the scenery was amazing. It must be fairly scary to be driving along the eastern fjords at night, especially since the wrong turn might result in your car driving off into the ocean.</p>

Shortcut through Öxi (route 939) and route to Egilsstaðir
</h1>
<p>This sounded like a great idea at the time (it was getting late, and we’ve just driven around 3 giant fjords… let’s just take a shortcut through the mountain, alright?). However, you can tell that the road had just newly been shovelled and was just opened for public use. While driving along the fjords (being so high and close to water) I had started getting panic attacks. However, Öxi took my panic attacks to a whole another level. The roads were slippery (still with ice), and the turns were both higher and much sharper than on the eastern fjords. Admittedly, I had to close my eyes for most of the route… although I’m sure that it is quite pretty in the summer.</p>

</figure>
<p>After we exited Öxi, we were on the higher plateau which contains Egilsstaðir. We ran into some reindeers and some more trees (super exciting!). Since the elevation was much higher than the southern part of the island, it was noticably colder as well.</p>
<figure>

To my surprise, while arriving in Egilsstaðir, we found out that it was actually a large-ish city (the largest city in eastern Iceland). The city itself has a population of about 2000 people, but I was mainly surprised by the urbanization (there were actually apartment buildings! And the houses do not look like idyllic rural farmhouses!)
<h1>
Arriving in Seyðisfjörður
</h1>
<p>We were not done our journey yet at Egilsstaðir. To get to Seyðisfjörður, you have to take a turn off route 1 (the ring road) onto route 93. Since Seyðisfjörður was a popular ferry port, it was been better maintained than Öxi. However, since it was going over some more mountains, route 93 also took us higher than the plateau where there was a lot of snow.</p>
<figure>

<p>Although at the point I was sick of elevation (panic attacks along Öxi), the view into Seyðisfjörður was breathtaking. The winding road down the mountain into Seyðisfjörður is probably my favourite memory of the whole Iceland trip.</p>
