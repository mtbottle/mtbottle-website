<p>This year was a mix of highs and lows.</p>
<p>I started the year with a visit from my parents to Berlin in January, then to Vienna to visit a cousin who owns a restaurant there. We visited many cafes and subsisted off coffee and cake.</p>
<p>In terms of books read, I was obsessed with Robin Hobb’s <em>Realm of the Elderling</em> and finished all 16 books within 3 months of starting. I had a love-hate relationship with the books; they made me obsessed about what would happen next, but I didn’t always like how it turns out. The series has ended now, so I’m still looking for the next series to be obsessed over.</p>
<p>The highlight of the year was my Maldives trip in March. It is the trip of a lifetime (literally, I don’t really want to spend so much money ever again for a holiday). We got to swim with fish, sharks and turtles and watch the sunset every evening. It’s the most idyllic place I’ve ever been to, and I can cross “seeing the Maldives before it sinks” off my bucket list of life to-dos.</p>
<p>Also, I had been really inspired to start watercolour in the spring. I’ve learned a lot by watching art vlogs and tutorials and I’m decently happy with my progress with urban sketching and watercolouring. If programming doesn’t work out for me, perhaps this can be my back-up career (mostly joking, I’ll need wayyyy more practice and business acumen to pull that off). Admittedly, I started drawing less by the end of summer as I got more responsibility at my job and had no energy for art after work.</p>
<p>We went to Mallorca in May. It was a beautiful island, and I can totally imagine myself living there long term. The weather was nice (could be because it was May in the Mediterranean) and there was a nice mix of mountains and ocean.</p>
<p>I went to Pydata Berlin in July and it cemented that I no longer enjoy conferences. I wrote a blog article about the topics discussed (which were interesting), but I just didn’t enjoy the conference environment itself.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I’ve been put into more technical leadership role this year and it has made me grow in a direction I never expected (less technical and more soft skills).</p>
<p>We visited Copenhagen in July. It was nice, but not super notable, other than getting rained on a lot.</p>
<p>We visited Hamburg again in August. It was nice, but not super notable, other than getting rained on a bit.</p>
<p>My low this year was my trip to the ER in August. This event has seriously made me reconsider settling down somewhere with a doctor where I have an established medical history and routine medical checkups.</p>
<p>The whole <em>settling down</em> aspect has also got me looking into property in Berlin and Toronto. Doing this has left me quite depressed and disillusioned with becoming a homeowner.</p>
<p>We went to Lisbon in September. It was a nice city, and I can also totally imagine myself living there long term. I need to make a note to go to Portugal again this year to wine and dine (perhaps Porto this time).</p>
<p>I visited Toronto in October with a one day layover in Iceland. I never noticed how expensive food seem to be in Canada, but maybe it’s because I’m unused to the currency. It has made me realize how <em>empty</em> my stay in Berlin has been in terms of social connections. I like Berlin in the abstract better than Toronto (better quality of life, attitude, urban layout), but I have no family, and very few friends or attachments here. I started a blog article comparing the 2 cities, which I might try to finish sometime.</p>
<p>I went to Blue Lagoon for the one day Iceland layover. It sucked because it was touristy and I went alone.</p>
<p>We visited the Dresden Weihnachtsmarkt in December. I think the one in Nuremburg is slightly better, but it was still an alright trip. We got a piece of the big stollen, at least.</p>
<p>Lastly, we stayed in Warsaw over Christmas with SO’s family. Nothing spectacular. I didn’t want to do anything, so we ended up not doing much. We did have daily walks to parks and forests, as well as a memorable cemetery tour through some cemeteries where famous people were buried. I did my last painting of the year of the Catholic Church in Powązki.</p>
<p>I didn’t reach any of my new years resolution I set up for myself last year. I think I gave up getting to B2/C1 level of German in April because I know enough to get by (mostly). I managed most communications in the hospital stay, everything food related and various bureaucratic things completely in Deutsch, but I had trouble buying a pair of shoes (“Haben Sie diese Schuhe in schwarz?” and “Ich wuerde gern diesen in groesse neun-und-dreizig anprobieren” is not enough). Then I gave up writing blogs in August as I found that I didn’t have great blog ideas every month. But this lead me back to my bad habit of drafting something and not publishing.</p>
<p>Overall, I’ve enjoyed travelling a lot less this year (especially the “let’s see another European city!” type) and am more inclined to keep my free time, free (boredom without stress is great). And ultimately, I will have to do some re-evaluation on what I find important in my life.</p>
