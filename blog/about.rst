title: About Me
---

I am a software developer from Toronto, Canada.
Although I work in technology, I am generally more of a techno-skeptic.

This is a personal blog where I write things that are of interest to me,
which is not always about technology.
Everything posted here are my own thoughts and don't necessarily reflect those of my employers.

My interests constantly changes, but the current list (as of 2019), they generally include:

* travel
* information security
* philosophy
* painting
